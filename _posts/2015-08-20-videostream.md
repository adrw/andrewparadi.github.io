**As Summer '15 Growth Intern, I got to work on three awesome projects on one of the most popular video streaming apps for Chromecast.**

I lead customer support for [Videostream](http://getvideostream.com/)'s then over 1.2 million customers (now close to 2 million!!). That meant resolving 2,148 email support tickets over 4 months and writing close to 90 canned responses so I could do my job more efficiently

With in depth customer knowledge and feedback, I could confidently redesign the [Videostream website](http://getvideostream.com/) to focus on the benefits that actually resonated with customers. The new website I developed beat split tests across the board and on certain metrics had up to 32% better download conversion rates than the old website.

The new website also got more users to come back to Videostream leading to a 12% increase in weekly active users that has remained since (not a one time boost)!

I worked on a new Premium flow in the app which makes upgrading to new features significantly easier for customers. I built the flow from scratch using HTML/Sass, Javascript, and integrations with Stripe, Paypal, and Google OAuth APIs. It's beating the original Premium flow in initial revenue split tests.
