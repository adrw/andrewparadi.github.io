**Welcome my new (much faster) blog! I'll have a post out soon about what's new but it's New Year's Eve! Before 2015 is finished, I'd like to share some of my favourite books I've finished since June ([1](/blog/leisure-reading-part-1/))!**

##Elon Musk - Ashlee Vance

This book was on my currently reading list back in June and two weeks after the post went up, I was finished. By now, most everybody has heard of Elon Musk and his three companies: Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and Solar City. Few know what he's like as a person.

Even after reading the book, I can't say that I understand him as a person. Elon Musk is exceptionally complex. He is clearly intelligent and has the drive to work 20 hour days. He is a passionate father of five sons yet still very calculating in how much time and emotion he allocates to family.

In interviews with co-founders, family, and employees, it became clear that labels or archetypes simply didn't grasp the complexity of the man. Elon isn't diagnosed with anything on the autism spectrum. Though Musk inspired Robert Downey Jr,'s portrayal of Tony Stark in Iron Man, Musk doesn't have the empathy of Stark. Musk even fired his long time secretary, Mary Beth Brown, unimaginable for the fictional Stark and his secretary Pepper Potts.

Elon Musk is unique. I don't need to rehash all the impressive headlines but what most impresses me is his analytical approach to addressing climate change. Similar to [Bill Gates](http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates), Musk believes that regulation and climate summits will do nothing. The only thing that will drive change is changing the economics of energy. Until solar or nuclear is cheaper than coal, there will be no mass migration away from fossil fuels.

Gates if funding unique energy innovations in wide fields. Musk is focused on optimizing all aspects of the solar economics equation. Solar City has drastically improved per unit costs and experience for solar panel installation. Tesla's new [Powerwall](https://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall) makes it possible to store energy and live entirely off the grid. And of course, Tesla cars are completely emission free (and jaw-droppingly fun to drive).

No doubt, we'll be reading more about Musk in the future. I'm glad I learned more about him this year.


##Emotional Intelligence 2.0 - Travis Bradberry &amp; Jean Greaves

I received this as a gift for my birthday in June and it certainly played as an ironic book to read after Ashlee Vance's *Elon Musk*. It's a great concisely written book with many good examples for the four key areas covering personal competence (self-awareness and self-management) and social competence (social awareness and relationship management).

Each category came 15-20 strategies that, though they sounded completely intuitive ("Don't be fooled by a bad mood", "Know who and what pushes your buttons", "Count to Ten"...), I realized that there were certainly many that I could be using more effectively.

When reading, I found myself imagining times when I (or somebody I knew) had successfully used (or failed to use) the strategy in a certain situation. Unlike Myers-Briggs, DISC, and EQI assessment literature, Emotional Intelligence 2.0 gave me practical insights that is helping me better manage my emotions and be more aware of others'.

Looking at successful people across industries and times, the ability to read, manage, and manipulate emotions has built empires, won wars, and inspired millions. Learning these skills ourselves gives us a good foundation to be successful in our own life.

##Stephen Harper - John Ibbitson

Okay, I confess. I follow politics. Mostly US politics (way more exciting) but this year was special. 2015 was a election year in Canada, and what a roller coaster it was.

Every party had their turn at the top of the polls. Yet the Liberal's Justin Trudeau is now Right Honourable, Prime Minister Stephen Harper is now former.

Despite growing up with Stephen Harper as Prime Minister for nearly as long as I can remember, I still didn't know much about him. This book was a unique window to look into one of the most reclusive Prime Ministers in Canadian history.

The book works in chronological order through young Steve's growing up in Toronto suburb Leaside, health problems that made him more hockey fan than player, and a short lived education at University of Toronto's prestigious Trinity College. The Trinity College section was fascinating having read months before about Jim Balsille's education there in Losing the Signal. The elite community that fostered RIM co-founder Jim Balsille's competitive spirit, repelled Harper who dropped out within weeks of his freshman year.

Harper escaped to Calgary where he transitioned from Trudeau Liberal to Reform conservative and from Steve to Stephen. Stephen Harper married, rose through the ranks of local riding associations, worked as assistant to MP's in Ottawa, and eventually became leader of the Alliance Party which merged with the Progressive Conservatives to become the Conservative Party that we know today.

The unique politics of Western Canada were interesting as were the behind the scenes narratives through the rest of the book of many of the headlines and scandals I had read about during Harper's ten years in power. What was most fascinating about John Ibbitson's book though, was the single realization that clarifies so many of the peculiarities of Harper's behaviour and leadership style.

Stephen Harper will take orders from no one.

*Stephen Harper* is the book one would write if given this thesis statement as an essay prompt. Harper's life is consistently used to point back as proof to this thesis and the proof is compelling. 

- Why would Harper drop out of UofT when he was an incredibly successful student in high school? 
- Why would he consistently buck the traditional "House of Cards" ladder-climbing loyalty that dominated the logic of his political peers, and quit or alienate himself from nearly every position he ever held? 
- Why would he break every PR rule by publicly attacking Canadian Supreme Court Justices? 
- Why would he ignore and try to bury non-partisan government officials and their reports?
- ...etc

Given this personality flaw that would have crippled most people to recurrent career failure and eventual humility, Harper's journey is remarkable. Instead of admitting defeat and gaining humility, Harper found a job where he would never have to take orders.
