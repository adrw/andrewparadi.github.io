**You can have all the right paint chips, but without a pattern it's not a picture, it's just paint on a wall.**

Q: My resume is a list of jobs and side-projects, how do I fix this?
---

Ever found that your resume or LinkedIn profile starts to feel like a bland list of cool stuff you've done but doesn't get you interviews?

Over the past few weeks, we've gone through the techniques ([1](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-1/) and [2](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-2/)) that will get your resume past hiring software into the hands of managers. 

*Software doesn't care* about focus or narrative so your list-of-cool-stuff-resume may do great on software search rankings but still not get you any interviews.

**You may have the resume keywords that impress software, but how do you impress hiring managers?**

> It's time to discover the power of the thesis.

Q: A thesis? That sounds familiar. Something, something... high school English?
---

A thesis is a **structured argument**. The central argument is *declared*, split into *evidence categories*, supported by specific *proof*, and reiterated frequently.

Though many of us will have learned this in the context of academic writing in high school English class, a thesis is radically applicable in so many other applications. 

This post has been on my mind for over a year precisely because it is such a *major key to great resumes, interview, and pitches*.

> Don't believe me? Keep reading...

Q: Why do I need a thesis?
---

Your resume is an argument for why you deserve an interview. A thesis structure is often the **the difference between a good resume and a persuasive resume**.

I've even had success thanks to using this structure in interviews, written applications, short pitches, and competition presentations.

> So yeah, a thesis works in more than just essays on the soliloquies of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

Q: Refresh my memory, how does a thesis work?
---

My high school English teacher, Mr. Blake, drilled into our heads how to structure a thesis. So here are his 5 steps using the example of proving that Scooby Doo is a dog.

1. **Declare** a strong, concrete argument (*Scooby is a dog*)
2. **Categorize** evidence into 2-5 groups (*Scooby is a dog and this is evident by his veterinary  certificate, visual resemblance to other dogs, and frequency of barking*)
3. **Support** categories with specific proof (*Scooby's veterinary certificate states that he is a Great Dane dog*)
4. **Generalize** the proof (*A veterinary certificate is a trusted document that is frequently used to certify animal breeds*)
5. **Reiterate the declaration** in the conclusion (*Thus, Scooby's veterinary certificate, visual resemblance to other dogs, and frequency of barking is evidence that Scooby is a dog*)

**D.C.S.G.R.** is not a particularly memorable acronym, but this thesis structure is how persuasion has worked for thousands of years.

> Even cavemen had to persuade a group where to go hunting next.

Q: Alright, so where's the formal *declaration, evidence categories, and proof* on your resume?
---

**It's all hiding in plain sight.** My resume still looks like anything you'd find on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/search?q=resume). 

The difference is that mine reads with **a persuasive, laser-focused message**. 

Hiring managers aren't looking for a *declaration* section, but they will be better persuaded when your resume has one baked in.

So here's my resume highlighted with the different areas of my thesis.

- Red: **Declaration**
- Orange: **Evidence categories**
- Green: **Supporting proof**

Where is the *generalized proof* and *reiterated declaration* on your resume?
---

Most of the *generalization* happens implicitly as someone is reading the resume given it is a less formal document and natural inferences are made naturally. 

As a manager scans through the resume, their eyes will naturally keep coming back to the bold, large-font *declaration*, effectively reiterating it without advertising-like repetition of a large headline on the page.

Q: How do I build my own declaration, evidence categories and proof?
---

Declaration
----

Ever been told your resume should start with an objective? Usually this ends up sounding pretty bland and simply regurgitates the job posting description.

*Objective: seeking intern position on a marketing team in the consumer packaged goods industry*

A thesis *declaration* gives you the opportunity to state your case: 

- what position you want
- why you're qualified for it
- how you'll be a better candidate than anybody else

**Make your declaration stand out.** Use bold or large font to treat it as a headline, or feature it in an About section. Put it at the beginning and make it noticeable so it can frame your resume deliberately in the minds of the reader.

![Say hello to my declaration in red.](/assets/article_images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-thesisc.png)

In my *declaration* I cover the following key areas:

- My name: *Andrew Paradi*
- The position I seek: *intern* (likely should be more specifically "dev intern")
- The desired hiring period: *summer '16*
- My competence: *ready* 
- The type of work I'm interested in: *tackle ambitious projects*

> Every person's declaration will have a different formula, so start with a base, then tweak, cut, and add until it's your own.

Evidence categories
----

Consider 2-6 specific *evidence categories* that can prove the competence and credibility of your *declaration*.

Given my *declaration* stating that I'm **ready to tackle ambitious projects**, my *evidence categories* are focused on proving both that I'm **ready** and that I have experience tackling **ambitious projects**. Here are my current ones:

- History of success in startups, competitions, and academic
- Strong coding &amp; communication skills recognized in competition
- Takes initiative
- Thrives under pressure
- Learns quickly
- Entrepreneur

Supporting Proof
----

When writing your resume, keep your *declaration* and *categories of evidence* in mind at all times.

Any experience, skills, or jobs you write about should be easily *categorized* and, transitively, prove your *declaration*.

Consider these examples of *proof* and their related *evidence categories (EC)*:

![EC: History of success in startups. Strong coding skills. Takes initiative. Learns quickly.](/assets/article_images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-proof1c.png)

![EC: History of success in startups, competitions. Strong communication skills recognized in competition. Thrives under pressure. Entrepreneur.](/assets/article_images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-proof2c.png)

![EC: History of success in competition. Strong coding &amp; communincation skills recognized in competition. Thrives under pressure.](/assets/article_images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-proof3c.png)

![EC: Takes iniative. Thrives under pressure. Learns quickly.](/assets/article_images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-proof4c.png)

**Note:** Seriously reconsider any experience, skill, or job that can't be *easily categorized* or doesn't directly prove your *declaration*. You should likely ditch it.

> Unrelated proof is clutter. It distracts from your declaration. It makes your thesis less persuasive.

Q: Any other tips?
---

The **tone of your writing is important** in your *declaration*, *evidence category names*, and *proof* (not to mention your cover letters and writing in general)!

*Passive tense makes you sound complacent... asleep at the wheel. Yawn.*

As much as possible, I stick to **simple past tense** on resumes or **present tense** in general to communicate with a direct, concrete tone.

- **Passive** (learning, teaching, programming...)
- **Simple Past** (built, developed, tested...)
- **Present** (pitch, present, develop, build...)

Eat the elephant one bite at a time

I know I hit you with a lot to think about. Restructuring your resume to be a persuasive thesis will take practice.

Now, I don't worry about getting my resume perfect on the first try (or the 21st try)! **My resume is a fluid piece of art**, so I can keep making it iteratively better ([**just like Kanye**](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11243072/kanye-west-life-of-pablo-new-song-tidal-update)).

For example, I'm still considering my layout and the position of **Education &amp; Skills**.

- Is this the most persuasive first proof a hiring manager could encounter? 
- Does the glance-able skills list prompt curiosity for my Github projects or seem like I'm blowing smoke?
- Is the density of information overwhelming and diminish their likelihood to read further?

These are just some of the questions I continue to think about in terms of my resume.

Test and see which *declaration* resonates, what *evidence categories* address hiring manager's questions, and which *proof* most concisely persuades someone to accept your *declaration*.

> Soon your resume will be a refined thesis that persuades hiring managers to schedule you for interviews.
