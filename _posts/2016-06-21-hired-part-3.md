excerpt: A thesis will make your resume more persuasive and memorable. It's not just for high school Shakespeare essays!
seo-title: "Make managers remember your resume with a strong thesis | Andrew Paradi"

Welcome back to *andrewnotes*:: **Hired**! Looking for earlier articles like [6 Questions to Focus your Resume on Impact](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-1/) or [Why Your Resume Needs SEO, and How](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-2/)?

**You can have all the right paint chips on a wall, but without a pattern tying them all together it's just paint on a wall.**

Q: My resume is a list of jobs and side-projects, how do I fix this?
---

Ever found that your resumes, LinkedIn profile, or even personal portfolio is full of cool stuff you've done with no central theme tying it all together?

Even with [great descriptions](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-1/) and [SEO-optimized featured skills &amp; stacks](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-2/), your resume can still lack focus. Over the past few weeks, we've gone through the techniques that will get your resume past hiring software into the hands of managers.

**You have the keywords that impress software, but how do you make managers notice your resume?**

> It's time to rediscover the power of the thesis.

Q: What's a thesis? Isn't it just for PhDs or high school English?
---

First, a thesis statement is a **central, concisely stated argument**. It's presented early, reiterated frequently, supported with proof, and repeated in the conclusion.

Second, a thesis isn't limited to a PhD thesis, high school English class, or academic arguments! This post has been on my mind for over a year because this thesis technique is *a major key for great resumes, interview, and pitches*.

> Don't believe me? Keep reading...

Q: Why do I need a thesis?
---

A strong, frequently reinforced thesis can be **the difference between a good resume and a great resume**. I've even had success using the following thesis technique for interviews, written applications, short pitches, and long presentations. 

So yeah, a thesis can be used in a *lot* more than a 5 paragraph essay on the spiritually alluding soliloquies of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

Q: Refresh my memory, how does a thesis work?
---

My high school English teacher, Mr. Blake, drilled into our heads how to structure a thesis. So here are his 5 steps using the example of proving that Scooby Doo is a dog.

1. Develop a strong, **concrete thesis** (*Scooby is a dog*)
2. Add **sub-arguments** to thesis (*Scooby is a dog and this is evident by his veterinary  certificate, visual resemblance to other dogs, and frequency of barking*)
3. **Prove** sub-arguments with specific proof (*Scooby's veterinary certificate states that he is a Great Dane dog*)
4. **Generalize** the proof (*A veterinary certificate is a trusted document that is frequently used to certify animal breeds*)
5. **Repeat** the thesis in the conclusion (*Thus, Scooby's veterinary certificate, visual resemblance to other dogs, and frequency of barking is evidence that Scooby is a dog*)

Q: Alright, so where's this formal "thy" "dost" "thesis" lingo on your resume?
---

**...Nowhere. No lingo.**

My resume still looks like any template you'd find on Dribbble. The difference is that mine reads with a persuasive, laser-focused message. Hiring managers certainly aren't looking for a *thesis*, but they can read the difference when your resume has one.

So here's my resume highlighted for the different areas of my thesis

- **Red**: thesis
- **Orange**: sub-arguments
- **Green**: proof

Q: So what do I put in my thesis, sub-arguments, and proof?
---

Thesis
----

Ever been told your resume should start with an objective? Usually this ends up sounding pretty bland and passive.

*Objective: seeking intern position on a marketing team in the consumer packaged goods industry*

A thesis gives you freedom to state your case: that you know what you want, why you're qualified for it, and how you'll be a better candidate than anybody else.

**State your thesis big and bold** (or even just in an About section) so it can shape the perceptions of the reader from beginning to end.

![Say hello to my thesis in red.](/assets/article_images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-thesisc.png)

In my thesis I cover the following key areas:

- My name: *Andrew Paradi*
- The position I seek: *intern* (likely should be more specifically "dev intern")
- The desired hiring period: *summer '16*
- My competence: *ready* 
- The type of work I'm interested in: *tackle ambitious projects*

> Every person's thesis will have a different formula, so start with a base, then tweak, cut, and add until it's your own.

Sub-arguments
----

From your thesis, consider 2-6 specific sub-arguments that can prove the competence and credibility of your thesis.

Given my thesis stating that I'm *ready to tackle ambitious projects*, my sub-arguments are focused on proving both that I'm *ready* and that I have experience tackling *ambitious projects*. Here are my current ones:

- *History of success in startups, competitions, and academics*
- *Strong coding &amp; communication skills recognized in competition*
- *Takes initiative*
- *Thrives under pressure*
- *Learns quickly*
- *Entrepreneur*

Proof
----

When writing your resume, keep your thesis statement (thesis + sub-arguments) in mind at all times.

Any experience, skills, or jobs you write about should directly prove one of the sub-arguments and, transitively, your thesis.

Consider these examples for proof and their related sub-arguments:

![SA: History of success in startups. Strong coding skills. Takes initiative. Learns quickly.](/assets/article_images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-proof1c.png)

![SA: History of success in startups, competitions. Strong communication skills recognized in competition. Thrives under pressure. Entrepreneur.](/assets/article_images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-proof2c.png)

![SA: History of success in competition. Strong coding &amp; communincation skills recognized in competition. Thrives under pressure.](/assets/article_images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-proof3c.png)

![SA: Takes iniative. Thrives under pressure. Learns quickly.](/assets/article_images/2016-06-21-hired-part-3/resume5annot2-proof4c.png)

Now in the same breath, any experience, skill, or job that doesn't relate to your thesis should be ditched.

> Unrelated proof is clutter. It is distracting. It makes your thesis less persuasive.

Q: Any other tips?
---

The **tone of your writing is important** in your thesis, sub-arguments, proof, resume, cover letters, and writing in general!

*Passive tense makes you sound complacent, asleep at the wheel. Yawn.*

As much as possible, I stick to **simple past tense** on resumes or **present tense** in general to communicate with a direct, concrete tone.

- **Passive** (learning, teaching, programming...)
- **Simple Past** (built, developed, tested...)
- **Present** (pitch, present, develop, build...)

I know I hit you with a lot to think about. Restructuring your resume effectively around a strong thesis takes practice.

Now, I don't worry about getting my resume perfect on the first try (or the 21st try)! **My resume is a fluid piece of art**, so I can keep making it iteratively better ([**just like Kanye**](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11243072/kanye-west-life-of-pablo-new-song-tidal-update)).

For example, I'm still considering my layout and the position of **Education &amp; Skills**.

- Should this be the first proof of my sub-arguments a reader encounters? 
- Does its quick glance nature facilitate more in-depth reading of my work experience &amp; projects?
- Is it overwhelming and diminish their likelihood to read further?

These are just some of the questions I think about in terms of my resume.

Test and see which thesis resonates, what sub-arguments address hiring manager's questions, and which proof most concisely and persuasively argue your sub-arguments. 

> Soon you'll have a refined thesis that persuades hiring managers to schedule you for interviews.

Split testing resumes can be tricky (I haven't found an *Optimizely for resumes* yet or else I'd be using it!). 

I use my thesis, sub-arguments, and proof in interviews &amp; when I meet someone new. Through their reaction, I can keep tweaking my message to find the phrases and stories that make their eyes light up (and then include them on my resume).

> Next week, I'll explain how you can prepare for and use interviews &amp; networking to test your thesis.
