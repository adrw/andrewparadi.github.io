**I never wanted to manually configure my OS environment again.**

After years of having to set aside a day or two to setup a new computer or reconfigure my environment after a clean OS install, I wanted to find a better way.

I started off with a simple shell script that copied my `.tmux`, `.vimrc` and `.zshrc` files to my home directory and installed some `Homebrew` packages.

Then a colleague introduced me to [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)...

Ansible is a framework that structures the provisioning process for a new machine or clean OS with declarative YAML files.

The basic components of Ansible are:
- Inventory: the machine or OS that Ansible will run on.
- Play: a unique, declared environment that will be installed on an Inventory.
- Role: a single configuration task. Example tasks that each would be an independent role: `Install my Homebrew packages`, `Configure my zsh`, or `Set my standard macOS defaults`.
- (Optional) `bootstrap.sh`: single script that can be triggered to provision a local machine. It likely will clone the `.files` repo, installs Ansible, and start the Ansible playbook.

My [`.files` repo](https://github.com/adrw/.files) holds my Ansible configuration, and all static scripts and files I need for a new machine. It works great on a clean macOS environment and I'll be expanding it to work on Linux soon.

If you'd like to build your own, feel free to fork [my repo](https://github.com/adrw/.files) or check out any of the helpful resources and examples below!
