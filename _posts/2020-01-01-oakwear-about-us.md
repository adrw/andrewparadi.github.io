img of us on train

Suzie and Andrew like funky sock designs but hate shopping for them.

You won't believe what happened next...

...okay... I really don't like writing in third-person... is it cool if we just talk more naturally?

Sweet! 

Oh, why are we dressed like elves? Well, we work in Santa's sock workshop! Just kidding, we've had a lot of fun volunteering on a local Santa train for kids.

What were we talking about? ...oh right, back to why shopping for socks kinda sucks.

Shopping for socks kinda sucks

Funky socks are all the rage with our friends and colleagues. So we asked them what frustrations they've had finding their latest pair: 

Retail stores have limited selection of designs and brands
Stores at the mall can be disorganized and the socks can be split up in different sections
Online stores have tons of socks, but it takes way too long to find a design I like.
I get overwhelmed with shopping. Once I've seen 20 or 30 designs, I just want to choose the least-bad one and be done with it.
I really don't want to pay $25 for a pair that I finally like, only to find out that shipping costs $12 too.
We want to change all of this. And, here's how we're going to do it...

Curation solves decision fatigue 

We have done the hard work to curate five very unique sock designs.  The sock designs are opinionated. They don't try to please everyone.

But, we have tried to make sure that at least one pair has a design that you love.

And, based on initial feedback on SERIES 1, we're pretty confident that one of them will truly vibe with you!

Plus, since there are only 5 pairs to choose from, you'll experience no decision fatigue, and spend hours less shopping for your next pair of funky socks. 

Fixed $1/pair shipping anywhere in Canada

We wanted to make sure that high shipping costs don't keep you away from a groovy pair of socks!

With lots of love for our home country, we've found a way to do flat $1/pair shipping anywhere in Canada!

P.S. We hope to bring this to the United States and Europe soon too! 

... and more to come!

We're excited to hear from you what you think of this new socks experience and your ideas of how we can improve.

Feel free to message the page on Facebook, email us at oakwearco@gmail.com, or include any feedback with your order.

â€“ Suzie & Andrew

P.S. Want to get back to the socks?
