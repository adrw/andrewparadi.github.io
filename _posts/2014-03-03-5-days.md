Every March, 5 Days for the Homeless campaigns on campuses across Canada raise awareness and funds for youth homelessness. At Wilfrid Laurier University, five applicant students are chosen to experience being homeless for five days.

Participants live in a corner of the Laurier courtyard and attend classes but cannot shower, use their smartphones, or change into clean sets of clothes. It has been a very effective way for students and staff to better understand the realities of youth homelessness as they walk to class or work with peers.

I lead video production for the primary promotion video for the 2014 Laurier campaign. Used on social media and the official fundraising website, the video helped the campaign surpass their goal of $25,000 for a local youth homeless shelter.

It was an honour to help with this cause.
