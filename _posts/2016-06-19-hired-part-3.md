My resume seems like a laundry list of jobs and side-projects, how do I fix this?
---

Ever found that your resumes, LinkedIn profile, or even personal portfolio ends up being filled with lots of cool stuff you've done, but no central theme tying it all together?

Even with [great descriptions](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-1/) and [SEO-optimized inclusion of skills &amp; stacks](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-2/), your resume can still be lacking focus. This post has been on my mind for months and I'm really excited to introduce this technique that is fundamental for resumes, interview, pitches, and any written application.

**It's time to rediscover the power of the thesis.**

What's a thesis? Isn't it just for PhDs or high school English?
---

First, a thesis statement is a central, concisely stated argument. It's presented early, reiterated frequently, supported with proof, and repeated in the conclusion.

Second, a thesis isn't limited to a PhD thesis, high school English class, or academic arguments! Don't believe me? Keep reading...

Why do I need a thesis?
---

A strong, frequently reinforced thesis can be the difference between a good resume and a great resume. I've even had success using the the following thesis technique for interviews, written applications, short pitches, and long presentations. My communications became more focused, persuasive, and effective. 

So yeah, a thesis can be used in a *lot* more than another 5 paragraph academic essay on the spiritually alluding sillolques of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

Refresh my memory, how does a thesis work?
---

My highschool English teacher, Mr. Blake, drilled into our heads how to structure a thesis. So here are his 5 steps using the example of proving that Scooby Doo is a dog.

1. Develop a strong, concrete thesis (Scooby is a dog)
2. Add sub-arguments to thesis (Scooby is a dog and this is evident by his vetrinary certificate, visual resemblance to other dogs, and frequency of barking)
3. Prove sub-arguments with specific proof (Scooby's vetrinary certificate states that he is a Great Dane dog)
4. Generalize the proof (A vertrinary certificate is a trusted document that is frequently used to certify animal breeds)
5. Conclude repeating the thesis (Thus, Scooby's vetrinary certificate, visual resemblance to other dogs, and frequency of barking is evidence that Scooby is a dog)

In addition to the steps, the tone of your writing can make a big difference. Passive tense makes you sound complacent and asleep at the wheel. As much as possible, I stick to simple past tense on resumes or present tense to communicate with a direct, concrete tone.

- Passive (learning, teaching, programming...)
- Past (built, developed, tested...)
- Present (pitch, present, develop, build...)

Alright, so where does all this formal lingo show up on your resume?
---

**Nowhere.**

My resume still looks like any template you'd find on Dribbble. The difference is the focus that mine has as if everything is tied together. Hiring managers certainly aren't looking for a thesis, but they can read the difference when you write your resume with one.

So here's my resume highlighted for the different areas of my thesis

- Red: thesis *Andrew Paradi is ready to tackle ambitious projects as a summer '16 intern*
- Orange: sub-arguments
- Green: Proof for the sub-arguments

![Resume 5.0 through the lens of thesis.](/assets/article_images/2016-06-19-hired-part-3/resume5annot2c.png)

Within my thesis I check the boxes of a standard resume objective. I describe the position I seek (*intern*), the co-op term I'm available (*summer '16*), and imply the competence and type of work I'm interested in (*ready to tackle ambitious projects*).

My sub-arguments use phrases that I've tested at networking events and on different versions of my resumes that have received a positive response

- *History of success in startups, competitions, and academics*
- *Strong coding &amp; communication skills recognized in competition*
- *Entrepreneur*

One aspect of my layout that is still in consideration is the position of **Education & Skills**. 

- Should this be the first proof of my sub-arguments that people see? 
- Does it help check their boxes so they can focus better on my work experience and projects?
- Does it appear overwhelming and diminish their likelihood to read further?

A resume, like your personal website or any digital media, is fluid. Test and see which thesis resonates, what sub-arguments address the readers questions, and which proofs most concisely and persuasively argue your sub-arguments. Over time you'll end up with a refined thesis that successfully persuades hiring managers to pick up the phone and schedule an interview.

Split testing resumes can be tricky (I haven't found an Optimizely for resumes yet or else I'd be using it!), so I tend to split test my thesis, sub-arguments, and proofs in networking conversations at events or with people I meet. I gauge their reaction and continually refine to find the phrases and stories that make their eyes light up.

> Next week, I'll explain how you can use this thesis mindset to effectively prepare for interviews and networking events.

[[3](/blog/hired-part-2/#3inline)] *Coming from a website conversion rate optimization background, I recognize that strategically chosen logos can imply credibility, reduce reader doubts, and draw attention. This is the primary reason why I have them on my resume. For example, Google for Entrepreneurs and Y Combinator logos draw attention and provide credibility to my startup experience at [Teknically](http://andrewparadi.com/project/teknically-webplio/).*

*For most situations, I'd recommend against logos. It's a very fine line between deliberately drawing attention to a specific job and simply adding logos because you can. Listing Adobe, software, or company logos that have no brand recognition will generally not help convey your content better. For my next major resume revision, I'll likely say goodbye to my logos for better readability and use of space.*
