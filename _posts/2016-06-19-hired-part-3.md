excerpt: A thesis will make your resume more persuasive and memorable. It's not just for high school Shakespeare essays!
seo-title: "Make managers remember your resume with a strong thesis | Andrew Paradi"
---

Welcome back to *andrewnotes*:: **Hired**! Looking for earlier articles like [6 Questions to Focus your Resume on Impact](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-1/) or [Why Your Resume Needs SEO, and How](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-2/)?

Q: My resume is a list of jobs and side-projects, how do I fix this?
---

Ever found that your resumes, LinkedIn profile, or even personal portfolio is full of cool stuff you've done, but no central theme tying it all together?

Even with [great descriptions](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-1/) and [SEO-optimized featured skills &amp; stacks](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-2/), your resume can still lack focus. 

This post has been on my mind for over a year! I'm really excited to introduce this technique that is *fundamental for resumes, interview, pitches, and any written application*.

**It's time to rediscover the power of the thesis.**

Q: What's a thesis? Isn't it just for PhDs or high school English?
---

First, a thesis statement is a **central, concisely stated argument**. It's presented early, reiterated frequently, supported with proof, and repeated in the conclusion.

Second, a thesis isn't limited to a PhD thesis, high school English class, or academic arguments!

Q: Why do I need a thesis?
---

A strong, frequently reinforced thesis can be **the difference between a good resume and a great resume**. I've even had success using the following thesis technique for interviews, written applications, short pitches, and long presentations. 

So yeah, a thesis can be used in a *lot* more than a 5 paragraph essay on the spiritually alluding soliloquies of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.

Q: Refresh my memory, how does a thesis work?
---

My high school English teacher, Mr. Blake, drilled into our heads how to structure a thesis. So here are his 5 steps using the example of proving that Scooby Doo is a dog.

1. Develop a strong, **concrete thesis** (*Scooby is a dog*)
2. Add **sub-arguments** to thesis (*Scooby is a dog and this is evident by his veterinary  certificate, visual resemblance to other dogs, and frequency of barking*)
3. **Prove** sub-arguments with specific proof (*Scooby's veterinary certificate states that he is a Great Dane dog*)
4. **Generalize** the proof (*A veterinary certificate is a trusted document that is frequently used to certify animal breeds*)
5. **Repeat** the thesis in the conclusion (*Thus, Scooby's veterinary certificate, visual resemblance to other dogs, and frequency of barking is evidence that Scooby is a dog*)

In addition to the steps, **the tone of your writing** can make a big difference. Passive tense makes you sound complacent and asleep at the wheel. As much as possible, I stick to simple past tense on resumes or present tense to communicate with a direct, concrete tone.

- **Passive** (learning, teaching, programming...)
- **Simple Past** (built, developed, tested...)
- **Present** (pitch, present, develop, build...)

Q: Alright, so where does all this formal lingo show up on your resume?
---

...
...
**Nowhere.**

My resume still looks like any template you'd find on Dribbble. The difference is the focus that mine has as if everything is tied together. Hiring managers certainly aren't looking for a thesis, but they can read the difference when you write your resume with one.

So here's my resume highlighted for the different areas of my thesis

- **Red**: thesis *Andrew Paradi is ready to tackle ambitious projects as a summer '16 intern*
- **Orange**: sub-arguments
- **Green**: Proof for the sub-arguments

![Resume 5.0 through the lens of thesis.](/assets/article_images/2016-06-19-hired-part-3/resume5annot2c.png)

Within my thesis I check the boxes of a resume objective. I describe:

- The position I seek (*intern*)
- The co-op term I'm available (*summer '16*)
- The competence and type of work I'm interested in (*ready to tackle ambitious projects*).

My sub-arguments use phrases that I've tested at networking events and on different versions of my resumes that have received a positive response

- *History of success in startups, competitions, and academics*
- *Strong coding &amp; communication skills recognized in competition*
- *Entrepreneur*

One aspect of my layout that is still in consideration is the position of **Education & Skills**. 

- Should this be the first proof of my sub-arguments that people see? 
- Does it help check their boxes so they can focus better on my work experience and projects?
- Does it appear overwhelming and diminish their likelihood to read further?

I know I hit you with a lot to think about. Restructuring your resume effectively around a strong thesis takes practice.

I don't worry about getting my resume perfect on the first try (or the 21st try)! My resume is a fluid piece of art, I can keep making it iteratively better ([just like Kanye](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11243072/kanye-west-life-of-pablo-new-song-tidal-update)).

Test and see which thesis resonates, what sub-arguments address the readers questions, and which proofs most concisely and persuasively argue your sub-arguments. 

> Over time you'll end up with a refined thesis that successfully persuades hiring managers to pick up the phone and schedule an interview.

Split testing resumes can be tricky (I haven't found an *Optimizely for resumes* yet or else I'd be using it!). 

I try to split test my thesis, sub-arguments, and proofs in networking conversations at events or with people I meet. I gauge their reaction and continually refine to find the phrases and stories that make their eyes light up.

> Next week, I'll explain how you can use a thesis to effectively prepare for interviews &amp; networking events.
