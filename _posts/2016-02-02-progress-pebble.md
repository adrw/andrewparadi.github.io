I got my refurbished Pebble Original Black for $60 at the first Hack the North.

It was so cool, exciting, and hackable! At that point I had very little coding experience, but using my Pebble every day kept me thinking of what I wanted to build on it.

After biking to school for months with an old speed tracker on my bike, there were always two metrics I never had:
- Average speed over my entire trip
- Changes in my average trip speed over months of riding

I wanted to see if I was making any progress in my endurance and speed without always needing my phone.

So I started building on a Pebble app to solve this problem.

With a basic app called Progress, I could use my Pebble to track my progress as a cyclist. From my wrist I could:
- Input my latest workout data on my Pebble
- Track stats like average speed, total distance, and total time
- Scroll through my recent workouts or trips

Though I've stopped working on it, you can still install it from the [Pebble store](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/56ad85eed3cf022d44000001) and check out the [source code on Github](https://github.com/andrewparadi/progress-pebble).

**Update Dec 7, 2016...I was really looking forward to my Kickstarter Time 2. Alas, it was not meant to be. Pebble is dead, Long live Pebble.**
