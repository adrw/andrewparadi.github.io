Thanks for your interest in OAKWEAR & CO. I'm in the middle of exams at university but I'll be back to fill out this page with the full sock story in a few weeks.

If you're interested in any of the socks, we do still have some stock of SERIES1. Check out the designs on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/oakwearco/), and [email us](mailto:oakwearco@gmail.com) so we can set up your order.

If you have any questions about your order, we still will be checking email for the next few months. Email us at [oakwearco@gmail.com](mailto:oakwearco@gmail.com).

We hope you enjoy your socks!
