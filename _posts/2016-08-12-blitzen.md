**As Summer '16 Developer and Growth Intern, I led signup and onboarding development and ended up boosting signups by 74%.**

At [Blitzen](https://blitzen.com/), I worked on all aspects of the signup and onboarding process from the main website to onboarding emails and initial in-app experience.

Starting with the main website, I worked on a better converting visitor experience with personality infused sales copy, featured press logos, and a simplified design. Using Optimizely, we tested the new variation against the old and after a few weeks of data, we knew with statistical certainty that my changes were having a signficant positive impact.

> There were a lot more signup notifications on Slack, but that wasn't as concrete as the 74% improvement waiting for us on Optimizely. 

I also sat in on marketing and sales meetings to listen to customer signup concerns as I worked on develompent plans for the onboarding experience. We collaborated on more effective onboarding emails within the Blitzen Django app and Mailchimp.

Using *Javascript, JQuery, and HTML/SASS*, I built interactive elements on the pricing page to allow for a more dynamic pricing based on # of contacts instead of arbitrary plans. With a slider and a simple Basic or Pro plan, prospective Blitzen users can upgrade to a plan perfect for them.
