seo-title: Baseway - the Marketplace for Local Student Talent
---

Baseway is a marketplace for local student talent. It connects local businesses and homeowners with students ready to help develop websites, design marketing materials, or even help with yard work or babysitting. Designed and prototyped in 54 hours at Startup Weekend KW September 2013 by the Baseway team.

I did extensive market research, customer interviews, produced the video below, and pitched to the judging panel and hundreds of competitors in attendance.

Startup Weekend introduced me to the startup scene at Communitech and I was hooked. Brandon Chow was on our team and in under a week he came to me with an initial idea that soon became <a href="/project/teknically-webplio/" target="_blank">Webplio</a>. Where Baseway ended, <a href="/project/teknically-webplio/" target="_blank">Teknically</a> began.
