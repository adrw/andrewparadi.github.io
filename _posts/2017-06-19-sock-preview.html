        <p>Suzie and I (that's us up there!) have been working the past few months on a new brand that solves problems in the socks and formal wear space!</p>

        <p>We’ve both been frustrated trying to find great patterns without spending an hour scrolling through the thousands of socks online.</p>

        <p>We're starting a curated sock and formal wear destination where you can find not 1,000 options, but a curated 10 patterns each month that are perfect for work, parties, or weddings.</p>

        <h2 id="but-we-need-your-help">…but we need your help!</h2>
        <p>We’d love to get some feedback on our idea from other people that buy socks!</p>

        <p>Is this a problem you also face? Are there other bigger problems we missed?
        What type of brand story would resonate with you?</p>

        <p>We’d really appreciate your help!</p>

        <p>Please give us feedback below, it’ll only take 5 minutes! :)</p>

So we're moving forward with a curated sock and formal wear destination where you can find the 10 best patterns for any occasion.

...but we need your help!
