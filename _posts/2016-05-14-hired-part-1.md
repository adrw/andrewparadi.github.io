excerpt: How to stop writing forgettable job descriptions that annoy recruiters and don't get interviews.
seo-title: "Hired: 6 Questions to Cut through Your Resume Fluff"
---

**It's hiring season again, which means it's time to update your resume.**

*Writing an effective resume is a challenge.* It isn't taught in school and online examples seem too generic to stand out for competitive jobs.

In the last two years I've looked at hundreds of resumes online and from successful friends, asked for critical resume feedback from recruiters and people I trust, and gone through 21 versions of my resume. 

Over the next couple weeks, I'm writing about mistakes I've made in resumes, interviewing, and negotiating job terms. 

More importantly, I'm sharing techniques to overcome them.

Welcome to *andrewnotes* :: **Hired**.

We'll start with one of the most important, most poorly done aspects of a resume: **job and side project descriptions**. 

Too often, they become forgettable lists of tasks you did, with common technologies verbosely explained unnecessarily.

Hiring managers need to be able to quickly grasp the impact you had. *Most descriptions annoy them so much they never finish reading the resume.*

**Your resume needs to spark enough curiosity that managers can't help but book an interview to learn more.**

In this post, I'll give you the technique that cuts through the fluff and will focus your descriptions on impact.

*Note: though most of the examples are from a software developer perspective, the mistakes and technique are useful for any resume. Pull your resume up and see how these techniques will help you.*


Don't mistake your resume for the interview
---

*"Everyone asks for your resume, so if I write a great one won't that get me the job?"*

I initially thought so. 

My early resumes were jam packed with everything that could prove I was the right candidate for the job.

As I got feedback from those I respect, I realized I was trying to make a resume do far more than it could.

A resume isn't a *history of past jobs*.

A resume isn't a *portfolio of accomplishments*.

So what is the purpose of a resume?

> A resume's only purpose is to spark enough curiosity that a manager can't help but book an interview.

Impact statements spark curiosity, Descriptions put recruiters to sleep
---

After realizing that my resume didn't need to answer every possible question (if they're that curious, they can book an interview), **I cut down text by almost 60%.**

**More importantly, I changed my descriptions to focus solely on impact.**

Here are two examples of text that could describe my internship last summer at [Videostream](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/).

Case A
-----

**Growth Intern at Videostream**

- Developed new website in HTML/CSS with Optimizely integration in adherance to Google Material Design language.
- Built new in-app premium page within Videostream Chrome App with Google Material Design to increase paid conversions.
- Solely responsible for all customer support emails in Freshdesk answering up to 100 per day all summer. Supported troubleshooting issues, feature requests, and premium upgrade questions.

Case B
-----

**Growth Intern at Videostream**

- Developed new site that boosted app downloads by 32%, weekly active users 12% 
- Built new Premium flow with Javascript, Material Design, & Stripe API
- Resolved 2,148 email tickets as support lead for Videostream's 1.2 million users

Case B is on my resume. But why?

> Case B is concise and focused on quantified impact.

Numbers are proof of my positive contribution to the team. They tell a story of *what I accomplished*, which is far more interesting than what *what tasks I did*. 

Hiring managers also can't resist the allure that I could achieve similar results for their team.

**So, how do you turn forgettable job descriptions (Case A) into memorable, quantified impact statements (Case B)?**

For each statement in your resume descriptions, ask yourself the following:

- **Is this statement as concise as possible?** 
  - Are you explaining processes or technologies unnecessarily? 
  - Long winded, unnecessary, verbose descriptions spark no additional interest in you as a candidate and reduce the chances any hiring manager will finish reading your resume.

- **Is there a percentage change you could use to quantify your impact?** 
  - Percentages inherently show context since it is relative to a baseline and can more accurately signify the importance of a change within a small data set. 
  - Increasing downloads by 25/week would be impressive with a baseline of 50/week (50% improvement) but insignificant if the baseline was 5,000/week (0.5% improvement). 
  - Percentage changes are exceptionally effective describing impact of growth (improved conversions, growth in user base, onboarding completion...) or reduction of undesirable events (support wait time, employee/customer turnover, avg QA batch test time...). 
  - Since percentage changes has a baseline context built in, they can be more broadly useful but have a greater variance of ///////////////////

- **Is there a static number that could be used?** 
  - Static numbers can be useful in 
    - providing context (size of user base, sales team size...) 
    - giving a concreteness to your impact claim (lines of code, number of new closed deals, number of customers helped) 
    - especially around money given how much people resonate with dollar figures (ie. I closed $85,000 in new sales may resonate more than I closed 12 new deals / grew our paid user base by 22%)
  - Smaller static numbers also rely heavily on context, saying you closed 3 new deals is only within the context of few deals/year so make sure to also give the context.
  - *Be careful* though because raw numbers can  be confidential data (esp. around user acquisition, revenue growth...) so check with your employer before using them. 
  - Examples
    - grew Webplio beta to 264 teams
    - led email support for user base of 1.2 million
    - resolved 2,148 support tickets

- **Do you have a choice between a static number and a percentage change?** Generally, choose the one that sounds, first, most believable, and second, most impressive. Claiming you increased sales by 800% sounds a bit like you're playing with the numbers than just admitting that at a small company with 10 existing customers, you closed the next 70 deals. Spark curiosity but don't write click bait.

- If no number can be shared, **ask yourself again, is this statement necessary?** Are you falling back into regurgitating a verbose job description or is this fundamentally important to understanding your experience as a candidate?

- Any job or project uses more frameworks, languages, and models than you could list, so be strategic. If there are no numbers but the statement is necessary, higlight technologies you used that are most relevant to your next job. 


Given most of you already have a resume, don't be surprised if these questions end up eliminating a lot of what you already had written.

> Getting rid of forgettable statements frees up space for you to write focused impact ones.

If you're stuck trying to determine your impact, try the following prompts:

- What metrics were part of *my position*? (# lines of code, tests passed, # commits, sales/month...)
- What metrics would *my boss* have been worrying about? (bug fixing time per sprint, errors/user, downtime...)
- What metrics on *another team* might I have impacted? (conversion rates, download rates, user growth, user acquisition rates, on-boarding completion, daily/weekly/monthly active users...)
- What metrics related to *business performance* could my work have impacted? (revenue growth, lifetime value per user, shopping cart abandonment rate, transaction completion rate...)
- How did I impact *customers*? (tickets resolved, ticket resolve time improvements, # customer demos...)

Not every position has a quantifiable impact, so focus on writing most concisely what you did. Consider the hiring manager who will read your resume and what technologies/skills they will be looking for your next desired position.

Strategically choosing what technologies or skills to feature is becoming vitally important.

Most internal hiring software now grades your resume based on keyword analysis. 

> Your resume needs to be optimized keywords just as much as a website is for Google Search rankings.

**Next week, I'll show you how to win the keywords that will put your resume in front of hiring managers.**
