seo-title: "Hired: Your Resume Needs SEO, Here's How"
---

Welcome back to *andrewnotes*:: **Hired**! (looking for [part 1](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-1/)?)

Hiring software in big corporations (and coming to startups near you) now rely on *keyword analysis* to rank resumes for recruiting manager.

**So what does this mean?**

If you want to rank high on Google, you've got to optimize a website for SEO. And if you want your resume to get past the hiring software to a real hiring manager, *you need to optimize your resume.*

Forgetting to optimize your resume is like forgetting to connect the locomotive to the rest of the train. Every boxcar can be ready to go, but without the engine it's not going anywhere. SEO is your resume's engine.

**In this post, I explain resume SEO and how you can optimize yours for hiring software and managers.**

Understand the Game
---

The key to winning any game, is knowing the rules. What strategies are allowed? What earns points? How do I win?

Hiring software is not standardized so I optimize mine based on a general understanding of keyword analysis in a search engine. Here's how it works [[1](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--seFcpj4P--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/18ix902ttt5hwpng.png)]:

1. Hiring software **parses** your resume to extract all relevant text and remove your formatting.
2. Parsed text is **categorized** as education, contact information, skills, or work experience for easier search.
3. Hiring managers use **search** keywords (ie. PHP developer) to find relevant candidates (just like searching Google).
4. Resumes are **prioritized and scored** based on semantic (same meaning) matching of keywords and years of experience.

**Therefore, there are two parts of this funnel to optimize.**

1. Make your resume easy to parse
2. Match the right search keywords

Software doesn't care what font you chose
---

When hiring software parses text out of your resume, it leaves behind all of your carefully chosen formatting.

*But wait! Once my resume gets a high score, then a hiring manager will see my beautiful resume!*

Think again. Managers will only see the parsed data within the search results. Only rarely might they hit download/view to see your resume.

For perfect parsing, think simple. 

- Write in the main body of the document or use simple, non-overlapping text boxes. 
- Use basic page formatting and font choices to show your eye for design 
- Use text focused software like LaTeX, Microsoft Word, or Apple Pages (I write mine in Pages but might switch to [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com) soon). All of these programs export to a simple PDF document that parses well.
- Refrain from unnecessary logos [[2](/blog/hired-part-2/#2)] or graphics that can mess up parsing. 
- Don't use Photoshop or other design software that is not primarily for text. It will slow you down in personalizing resumes in bulk and increases risk of output as a PDF image (which is useless for parsing since it's an image, not text).

I'm no expert designer and I don't pronounce it "[aluminium](https://youtu.be/V_RyFkkCuLU)", but I do know that **good design gets out of the way**.

Don't get me wrong, design is important and it can be a distinguishing aspect for your resume, but readability and parse-ability are paramount. 

If you're submitting your resume online, most managers won't see your design. If they do, they'll spend maybe 15 seconds scanning to see if you're worth an interview.

**Make those 15 seconds count with design that doesn't distract from your content and is easy to parse.**


Learn the language of the job posting
---

SEO requires both excellent research and strategic execution. Here's how I do both on my resume.

First, I look for specific terms, technologies, or verbs to target for a specific job posting. I look for the frequency that they appear in:

- The specific job listing you're applying to
- Other related posts from the same company
- Similar job posts from different companies (look on their websites, university co-op listings, [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.ca/index.htm)...etc)

**Consider unique aspects of the company you're applying to.**

- Do they use a specific sprint planning method? 
- Do they organize their teams in a certain way? 
- Do they reiterate the same desired soft-skills in each post?

**Identify specific terms or groups of synonymous terms that are specific to your position.**

- What's their technology stack? 
- What are similar technologies where experience would be an asset? (C++ to Java, AngularJS to React...)
- What are they building? Have I built something similar?

Hiring software uses *semantic* matching. This means that the keywords on your resume can still rank highly on non-identical search keywords, the keywords just need to mean the same thing. 

For example, searches for *software developer* will also pick up resumes that include *software developer*, *programmer*, *software engineer*, and *hacker* since all are job descriptions that would have similar experience.

I tend to prioritize sets of synonymous terms for the technology stacks, skills, position title, and verbs used frequently in job postings.

Put keywords everywhere, strategically
---

Second, once I've researched and chosen my keywords, I integrate them into my resume's job descriptions, personal mantra, and skills sections. I swap out skills or terms depending on the differences between job positions. 

![Despite using over a dozen different frameworks on that hack, the description focuses on my use of a Google Maps Javascript API and PayPal API for a front end job posting.](/assets/article_images/2016-05-23-hired-part-2/resume-htn2015c.png)

If I'm applying to a bunch of AngularJS centric front-end dev jobs, then my technologies will mostly stay the same but skills or other terms may change. Between a full-stack dev and a database admin position my technology and skills would likely both vary greatly.

![Skills sections from two resumes that were submitted to a generic dev position (left) vs a javascript centric position (right).](/assets/article_images/2016-05-23-hired-part-2/resume-skills-x2c.png)

For the first of each generic job position, I'll save major changes (skills, descriptions changes...) as a template so I can efficiently only apply quick personalizations within similar jobs.

![A few of my resume templates for the types of jobs I was applying for in January 2015.](/assets/article_images/2016-05-23-hired-part-2/resume-templatesc.png)

Within my personal mantra section, I'll adjust words or remove entire phrases that may not be as relevant to a position I'm applying to. I'll be talking more about this section in next week's post but here's one on a current resume.

![Mantra section from my resume that focuses on core soft skills and competencies, organized by priority of that position.](/assets/article_images/2016-05-23-hired-part-2/resume-mantrac.png)

Taking the time to personalize your resume to a specific job posting pays dividends. Your resume will rank hired in hiring software because of your deliberate keyword optimization. Focused impact statements in job descriptions towards the language of a specific job posting will stand out to hiring managers among the generic "Spray and Pray" resumes from other applicants.

*[[2](/blog/hired-part-2/#2inline)]  Coming from a website conversion rate optimization background, I recognize that strategically chosen logos can imply credibility, reduce reader doubts, and draw attention. This is the primary reason why I have them on my resume. For example, Google for Entrepreneurs and Y Combinator logos draw attention and provide credibility to my startup experience at [Teknically](http://andrewparadi.com/project/teknically-webplio/).

For most situations, I'd recommend against logos. It's a very fine line between deliberately drawing attention to a specific job and simply adding logos because you can. Listing Adobe, software, or company logos that have no brand recognition will generally not help convey your content better. For my next major resume revision, I'll likely say goodbye to my logos for better readability and use of space.*
