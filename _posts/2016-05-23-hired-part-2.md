Welcome back to the *andrewnotes*::**Hired** series! (looking for [part 1](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/hired-part-1/) about making your resume impact focused?)

Hiring software in big corporations (and now trickling down to startups) now rely on keyword analysis to rank resumes for recruiting manager.

So what does this mean?

If you want to rank high on Google, you've got to optimize a website for SEO. And if you want your resume to get past the hiring software to a real person, you need to optimize your resume. We need to treat our resumes like a website. 

In this post we cover a couple techniques that I've found helpful in optimizing my resume for hiring systems and recruiters.

Understand the Game
---

The key to winning any game, is knowing the rules. What strategies are allowed? What earns points? How do I win?

Hiring software is not standardized so I optimize mine based on a general understanding of keyword analysis in a search engine. Here's how one works:

1. Hiring software runs your resume through a parsing system that extracts all relevant text and removes your formatting.
2. Parsed text is bucketed by education, contact information, skills, work experience for easier search.
3. Hiring managers use search keywords to find relevant candidates
4. Resumes are returned based on a relevancy score based on semantic (same meaning) matching of keywords and years of experience

Therefore, there are two primary areas of this funnel to optimize.
1. Make your resume easy to parse
2. Match employer keywords

Hiring software doesn't care what font you choose
---

When hiring software parses text out of your resume, it leaves behind all the carefully chosen fonts, precisely aligned text boxes, and strategic seperating lines between sections.

But wait! Once my resume gets a high score, then a hiring manager will see my beautiful resume!

Think again. Managers will only see the parsed data within the search results. Only rarely might they hit download/view to see your resume.

A gorgeous design can't make up for a resume that doesn't parse well.

<a name="1inline" id="1inline"></a>
For perfect parsing, think simple. 

- Write in the main body of the document or use simple, non-overlapping textboxes. 
- Use basic page formating and font choices to show your eye for design 
- Use text focused software like LaTeX, Microsoft Word, or Apple Pages (I write mine in Pages but might switch to [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com) soon). All of these programs export to a simple PDF document that parses well.
- Refrain from unnecessary logos [[1](/#1)] or graphics that can mess up parsing. 
- Don't use Photoshop or other design software that is not primarily for text, can be a pain to edit quickly, and risk output as a PDF image (useless for parsing).

I'm no expert designer and I don't pronounce it ["aluminium"](https://youtu.be/lJx6cF-H__I). But I do know that **good design gets out of the way**.

Don't get me wrong, design is important and it can be a distinguishing aspect for your resume, but readability and parseability is paramount. If you're submitting our resume online, most managers won't see your design. If they do, they'll only spend 15 seconds scanning to see if you're worth an interview.

Make those 15 seconds count with design that doesn't distract from your content.


Learn the language of the job posting
---

SEO requires both excellent research and strategic execution. Here's how I do both on my resume.

First, I look for specific terms, technologies, or verbs to target for a specific job posting. I focus on technologies, verbs, or desired skills, their synonyms, and the frequency they appear in a variety of sources:

- The specific job listing you're applying to
- Other related posts from the same company
- Similar job posts from different companies (look on their websites, university co-op listings, [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.ca/index.htm)...etc)

Look for unique aspects of the company you're applying to. 

- Do they use a specific sprint planning method? 
- Do they organize their teams in a certain way? 
- Do they reiterate the same desired soft-skills in each post?

Identify specific terms or groups of synonymous terms that are specific to your position. 

- What's their technology stack? 
- What are similar technologies where experience would be an asset? (C++ to Java, AngularJS to React...)
- What are they building? Have I built something similar?

Hiring software uses *semantic* matching. This means that the keywords on your resume can still rank highly on non-identical search keywords, the keywords just need to mean the same thing. For example, searches for *software developer* will also pick up resumes that include *software developer*, *programmer*, *software engineer*, and *hacker* since all are job descriptions that would have similar experience.

I tend to prioritize groups of synonoumous terms relating to technology stacks, skills, position title, and verbs in the description.

Put keywords everywhere, strategically
---

Once I've chosen my keywords after some research, I work to integrate them into my resume's job descriptions, personal mantra, and skills sections. I swap out skills or terms depending on the differences between job positions. 

![job description focusing on x]

If I'm applying to a bunch of AngularJS centric front-end dev jobs, then my technologies will mostly stay the same but skills or other terms may change. Between a full-stack dev and a database admin position my technology and skills would likely both vary greatly.

![Side by side skills differing sections]()

For the first of each generic job position, I'll save changes as a template so I can efficiently only apply quick personalizations within similar similar jobs.

Within my personal mantra section, I'll adjust words or remove entire phrases that may not be as relevant to a position I'm applying to. I'll be talking more about this section in next week's post but here's one on a current resume.

Taking the time to personalize your resume to a specific job posting pays dividends. Your resume will rank hired in hiring software because of your deliberate keyword optimization. Focused impact statements in job descriptions towards the language of a specific job posting will stand out to hiring managers among the generic "Spray and Pray" resumes from other applicants.
