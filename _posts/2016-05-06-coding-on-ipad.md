excerpt: How to be productive on iPad and why I choose it over my Macbook Pro

#Q: Woah, you're coding on an iPad?!
#A: Yes, yes I am.

Since September, I have brought only my iPad to classes. With the exception of one math class in the Fall, I've taken all my notes on my iPad.

For CS136 and CS246, I've done significant portions of coding on my iPad. And for my blog and other writing, I've written tens of thousands of words on my iPad.

Despite how productive I am with an iPad, it still has the stigma of a simple media consumption device. 

This dissonance prompted many questions from classmates this semester who weren't surprised by a terminal running on a Microsoft Surface, but were astonished to see one running just as well on an iPad.

Today, I explain how I'm productive on an iPad and why I choose iPad in spite of it's limitations.

#How I am productive on iPad
Productivity on an iPad is a function of how well you can manage with a bluetooth keyboard, and whether there exist steller apps for the tasks you need to accomplish.

After years trying different keyboards, I found the [Brydge Air](http://www.brydgekeyboards.com/collections/ipad-air-air-2-pro-9-7-inch). It has a pesky Siri key where the fn key should be but is otherwise flawless.

Within the last year, iOS9's keyboard support and split view multitasking has made doing real work on the iPad possible. I've found the two app limit often liberating as it lets me focus on a single task with no visual clutter.

I could take notes from my textbook in iBooks with [OneNote](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-onenote-lists-photos/id410395246?mt=8) open side by side. Othertimes I'd be coding a CS assignment with the spec open in [Documents](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/documents-5-fast-pdf-reader/id364901807?mt=8) and a terminal in [Coda 2](https://www.panic.com/coda-ios/) to work on the school linux server. And somedays I would just use [Outlook](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-outlook-email-calendar/id951937596?mt=8) full screen and crank through my inbox.

For nearly all of the tasks I did every day, the iPad was the more productive choice.

#Why iPad?
Though there are areas where the iPad falls short in productivity, it soars ahead in portability. It is light, has a small footprint, and a battery that will last a full day. 

Every day (except when CS246 assignments were due), I was willing to sacrifice some productivity for a few less weight on my back and no battery *range anxiety*.

Beyond this simple tradeoff, learning how to use an iPad productively is preparation for the future.

#iPads are the future? C'mon
Each computing generation has been disrupted by a cheaper, less powerful, less "productive" class of computing devices. Microcomputers (Macs & PCs)  of the 1980s disrupted the minicomputers of the 1970s which disrupted the supercomputers of the 1960s. 

iPads and smartphones are the next major paradigm. For most people, the simplicity and further abstraction from the desktop mouse & keyboard model presents a more approachable UX in a more portable device. A winning formula.

Kids now learn to use smartphones and iPads at home, and Chromebooks in school long before they ever touch a "real" desktop running OS X or Windows. My Mom does most of her email on her phone. My grandparents and many of their friends have switched from overpowered PCs to iPads for easier emailing and Skyping grandkids.

**Moreover**, just this year Google announced that more searches are now done on phones or tablets than desktops (http://www.theverge.com/2015/5/6/8558535/google-mobile-search-vs-desktop). This tipping point where most of any website's traffic is coming from mobile is approaching very quickly.

> The shift of web traffic from desktop to mobile will be the most radical change the internet has ever seen.

[Gary Vaynerchuk](https://youtu.be/wbdYg6X1e-g) got me thinking about how this shift will impact B2B. He suggests that websites that rely on traditional techniques of Google Adwords, email lists, pop up forms, or display ad revenue will adapt or die when these lucratrive strategies stop working on mobile.

> And he's got a point.

[People ignore ads](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/03/survey-says-63-of-you-ignore-the-ads-on-this-very-page/). [Mobile browsers cripple websites](http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/20/9002721/the-mobile-web-sucks). [Few smartphone users are installing new apps anymore](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2014/08/26/android-users-average-95-apps-installed-phones-according-yahoo-aviate-data/).  Facebook and Twitter open links with in-app browsers that most people close without clicking to any other pages.

> The internet was built on the browser. And people aren't browsing anymore. Houston, we have a problem.

[Chat bots](http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/12/11395806/facebook-messenger-bot-platform-announced-f8-conference). [Instagram influencers](http://www.cnbc.com/2014/04/11/instagram-influencers-models-make-thousands-working-on-instagram.html). [YouTube celebrities](https://www.youtube.com/user/JusReign). Ford, Samsung, and other huge companies are sponsoring videos like [this](https://youtu.be/4ESy8WRyVcs) and [this](https://youtu.be/soxxPyaAT1k). Watch those and ask yourself if you'd remember any Ford or Samsung TV ad better than that YouTube placement. 

> The world is moving from mobile first, to mobile only. 

**Furthermore**, tablets and smartphones are how the next 3 billion people will first experience computers and the internet. Over 80% of people in the West are already online. Meanwhile less than 46% of China, 19% of India, and 1% of another 178 developing countries have access to the internet (http://www.internetlivestats.com/internet-users/#trend).

Smartphones and tablets that we brush off as inferior devices to the all mighty laptop will be the primary computers for billions of people. Smartphones have become increasingly affordable, cellular networks continue to expand, and entrepreneurs have already recognized the huge opportunity.

> Services like banking, education, and healthcare can now be provided through text message &amp; limited data connections to underserved markets. 

Digital mobile banking and access to credit could reach up to 2 billion new people by 2030. This would spur local economies and increase living standards across the developing world (http://www.theverge.com/2015/2/4/7966043/bill-gates-future-of-banking-and-mobile-money). 

Literacy and reading rates are already rising among those with mobile phone. An app like Worldreader can distribute 1,000 pages of an e-book for just 2-3 cents (http://www.theverge.com/2014/4/23/5643058/mobile-phone-reading-illiteracy-developing-countries-unesco).

#Conclusion
In 2010, the early days of iPad, Steve Jobs told a speechless audience that desktop ("PCs are going to be like trucks")[https://youtu.be/YfJ3QxJYsw8], iPads and tablets are going to be like cars. For every 30 cars you see on a road, there might be one truck. And that might make some people uncomfortable.

Six years later, I'm surprised that already a third of all new computers in my classes are Microsoft Surfaces or iPads. 

Using my iPad and iPhone as primary devices forces me to engage with the new limitations, user experiences, opportunities, and challenges in this next wave of computing.
