seo-title: Teknically &amp; Webplio - the future of Google Analytics
---

**Brandon Chow and I founded Teknically in October 2013 and over the next 13 months had a remarkable journey.**

We thrived in Laurier Launchpad, won national competitions, joined Google for Entrepreneurs and interviewed at Y Combinator. 

We did hundreds of customer interviews to find the pain points small business owners have in understanding Google Analytics. We pioneered machine learning math techniques that let us pull insights from complex Google Analytics data sets. 

The full story is covered over two posts ([1](/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/), [2](/blog/the-dream-fades/)). Since going back to school at University of Waterloo, I've continued to [write](/blog/) about what we learned with Teknically and my perspective on different startup issues.

Below is some promotional media from Teknically, Webplio, and our winning pitches in competitions.
