seo-title: Tinder for Blogs
---

**This summer I'm writing a post every week.** 

**And you can use Tinder to choose what I write next.**

Each post will answer a *frequently asked question* from friends, classmates, or from the Tinder form below every post.

**I'm stoked to start this journey together!** We're going to travel through different topics and discussions around how to:

- *Land your dream job* – stop missing out on interviews, getting underpaid, and figure out stand out
- *Lead a team or startup like a pro* – stop making rookie mistakes that destroy culture and lead to failure
- *Manage finances so you can have real freedom for life* – it doesn't even require moving to 'Murica!
- *...and answers to other questions you have!*

**Now like any millennial,** I don't think we need to give this name. We don't need to formalize this relationship. 

> This is going to be Tinder for blogs.

1. *If you like what you read*, **swipe right** and join the email newsletter below!
2. *If you think the post was kinda meh*, **swipe left** and suggest a topic that you'd rather read next time.
3. **Please help me test this today**, swipe right or left below!

So that's the plan! *andrewnotes* is getting a reboot...and this next chapter is going to be an adventure together!

**The next post drops this Friday so swipe left or right and enter your email below so you don't miss it.**
