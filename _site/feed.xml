        <title>My Favourite 6 Books Since June</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome my new (much faster) blog! I&amp;#39;ll have a post out soon about what&amp;#39;s new but it&amp;#39;s New Year&amp;#39;s Eve! Before 2015 is finished, I&amp;#39;d like to share some of my favourite books I&amp;#39;ve finished since June (&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/leisure-reading-part-1/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;)!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Elon Musk - Ashlee Vance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-12-31-leisure-reading-part-2/elon-musk-ashlee-vance.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book was on my currently reading list back in June and two weeks after the post went up, I was finished. By now, most everybody has heard of Elon Musk and his three companies: Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and Solar City. Few know what he&amp;#39;s like as a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after reading the book, I can&amp;#39;t say that I understand him as a person. Elon Musk is exceptionally complex. He is clearly intelligent and has the drive to work 20 hour days. He is a passionate father of five sons yet still very calculating in how much time and emotion he allocates to family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In interviews with co-founders, family, and employees, it became clear that labels or archetypes simply didn&amp;#39;t grasp the complexity of the man. Elon isn&amp;#39;t diagnosed with anything on the autism spectrum. Though Musk inspired Robert Downey Jr,&amp;#39;s portrayal of Tony Stark in Iron Man, Musk doesn&amp;#39;t have the empathy of Stark. Musk even fired his long time secretary, Mary Beth Brown, unimaginable for the fictional Stark and his secretary Pepper Potts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk is unique. I don&amp;#39;t need to rehash all the impressive headlines but what most impresses me is his analytical approach to addressing climate change. Similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ted.com/talks/bill_gates&quot;&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt;, Musk believes that regulation and climate summits will do nothing. The only thing that will drive change is changing the economics of energy. Until solar or nuclear is cheaper than coal, there will be no mass migration away from fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gates if funding unique energy innovations in wide fields. Musk is focused on optimizing all aspects of the solar economics equation. Solar City has drastically improved per unit costs and experience for solar panel installation. Tesla&amp;#39;s new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall&quot;&gt;Powerwall&lt;/a&gt; makes it possible to store energy and live entirely off the grid. And of course, Tesla cars are completely emission free (and jaw-droppingly fun to drive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scontent-ord1-1.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-frc/t51.2885-15/e15/10731621_742514089151424_1105265047_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My second Tesla Model S test drive in California. This time, with the high performance Model S P85 edition.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No doubt, we&amp;#39;ll be reading more about Musk in the future. I&amp;#39;m glad I learned more about him this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Emotional Intelligence 2.0 - Travis Bradberry &amp;amp; Jean Greaves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-12-31-leisure-reading-part-2/Emotional_Intelligence_2.0-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received this as a gift for my birthday in June and it certainly played as an ironic book to read after Ashlee Vance&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;#39;s a great concisely written book with many good examples for the four key areas covering personal competence (self-awareness and self-management) and social competence (social awareness and relationship management).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each category came 15-20 strategies that, though they sounded completely intuitive (&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be fooled by a bad mood&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Know who and what pushes your buttons&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Count to Ten&amp;quot;...), I realized that there were certainly many that I could be using more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When reading, I found myself imagining times when I (or somebody I knew) had successfully used (or failed to use) the strategy in a certain situation. Unlike Myers-Briggs, DISC, and EQI assessment literature, Emotional Intelligence 2.0 gave me practical insights that is helping me better manage my emotions and be more aware of others&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at successful people across industries and times, the ability to read, manage, and manipulate emotions has built empires, won wars, and inspired millions. Learning these skills ourselves gives us a good foundation to be successful in our own life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Stephen Harper - John Ibbitson&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-12-31-leisure-reading-part-2/stephen_harper_john_ibbitson.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, I confess. I follow politics. Mostly US politics (way more exciting) but this year was special. 2015 was a election year in Canada, and what a roller coaster it was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every party had their turn at the top of the polls. Yet the Liberal&amp;#39;s Justin Trudeau is now Right Honourable, Prime Minister Stephen Harper is now former.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite growing up with Stephen Harper as Prime Minister for nearly as long as I can remember, I still didn&amp;#39;t know much about him. This book was a unique window to look into one of the most reclusive Prime Ministers in Canadian history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book works in chronological order through young Steve&amp;#39;s growing up in Toronto suburb Leaside, health problems that made him more hockey fan than player, and a short lived education at University of Toronto&amp;#39;s prestigious Trinity College. The Trinity College section was fascinating having read months before about Jim Balsille&amp;#39;s education there in Losing the Signal. The elite community that fostered RIM co-founder Jim Balsille&amp;#39;s competitive spirit, repelled Harper who dropped out within weeks of his freshman year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harper escaped to Calgary where he transitioned from Trudeau Liberal to Reform conservative and from Steve to Stephen. Stephen Harper married, rose through the ranks of local riding associations, worked as assistant to MP&amp;#39;s in Ottawa, and eventually became leader of the Alliance Party which merged with the Progressive Conservatives to become the Conservative Party that we know today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unique politics of Western Canada were interesting as were the behind the scenes narratives through the rest of the book of many of the headlines and scandals I had read about during Harper&amp;#39;s ten years in power. What was most fascinating about John Ibbitson&amp;#39;s book though, was the single realization that clarifies so many of the peculiarities of Harper&amp;#39;s behaviour and leadership style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Harper will take orders from no one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stephen Harper&lt;/em&gt; is the book one would write if given this thesis statement as an essay prompt. Harper&amp;#39;s life is consistently used to point back as proof to this thesis and the proof is compelling. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would Harper drop out of UofT when he was an incredibly successful student in high school? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would he consistently buck the traditional &amp;quot;House of Cards&amp;quot; ladder-climbing loyalty that dominated the logic of his political peers, and quit or alienate himself from nearly every position he ever held? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would he break every PR rule by publicly attacking Canadian Supreme Court Justices? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why would he ignore and try to bury non-partisan government officials and their reports?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;...etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this personality flaw that would have crippled most people to recurrent career failure and eventual humility, Harper&amp;#39;s journey is remarkable. Instead of admitting defeat and gaining humility, Harper found a job where he would never have to take orders.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Startups Fail Even with Cash and Growth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everybody in startups should be reading Paul Graham&amp;#39;s essays. He just hit it out of the park again. Go read &lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/aord.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Default Alive or Default Dead?&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; and then come back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve co-founded a startup (&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-dream-fades/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;), worked as a growth intern at another (&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;), and met with hundreds of founders over the past two years. These classic 3 steps to success more often than not were the foundation for too many startups:
- Funding will finally let us hire, scale, grow, develop, succeed...
- Growth will get us funding
- Collect $100k - $100 million from VCs, Rinse, Repeat&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m as guilty as any to have held this view. After reflecting on Teknically and working with other startups since, my eyes have been opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Graham puts it so well in his latest post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a common way startups die. They make something moderately appealing and have decent initial growth. They raise their first round fairly easily because the founders seem smart and the idea sounds plausible. But because the product is only moderately appealing, growth is ok but not great. The founders convince themselves that hiring a bunch of people is the way to boost growth. Their investors agree. But (because the product is only moderately appealing) the growth never comes. Now they&amp;#39;re rapidly running out of runway. They hope further investment will save them. But because they have high expenses and slow growth, they&amp;#39;re now unappealing to investors. They&amp;#39;re unable to raise more, and the company dies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just speechless how clearly this explains the systematic failure inherent in the most common founder perspective on startup success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Founders are baited by initial VC money to optimize for quick launch and fast growth. This all to the peril of building a product and business model that will last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to dismiss this and believe that your startup and perspective is different. Yet, too many founders are blind leading the blind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many startup cultures don&amp;#39;t encourage any employees to voice concerns or ask questions. Founders spin anything to reinforce their viewpoint that success will come with the next founding round or growth spurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish more founders would step back and realize if they&amp;#39;re default dead or default alive. I didn&amp;#39;t do this myself in Teknically and regret the ultimate cost of our &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s going great&amp;quot; culture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, we were default dead. We just didn&amp;#39;t realize it until we had died.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Videostream: How Growth Starts with Great Customer Support</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a Growth Intern at &lt;a href=&quot;http://getvideostream.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Videostream&lt;/a&gt;, I used my customer support job to hack growth on all fronts. After answering thousands of customer emails, I could write sales copy that resonated. Website downloads went up by 32%, weekly active users grew 12%, and revenue even went up! Find out how you can do it too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Update Oct 22: Approval from legend &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/copyhackers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Joanna&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://copyhackers.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Copyhackers&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;nice work! *really* great study on optimizing for growth in a short period of time &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/BZPdRb2Pbj&quot;&gt;https://t.co/BZPdRb2Pbj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Joanna Wiebe (@copyhackers) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/copyhackers/status/657363804162949121&quot;&gt;October 23, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Customer Support Lead for 1.2 million user base&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As customer support lead for Videostream&amp;#39;s 1.2 million user base, I answered a lot of email every day. I was the first point of contact anytime a Videostream user had an issue, feature request, or even just wanted to share how much they loved our app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At times it was overwhelming, occasionally humbling, and on a lucky day, I&amp;#39;d receive a genuinely hilarious email and try to craft my wittiest reply. For most emails though, I started to recognize patterns in both support and testimonials. For faster responses, I wrote almost 90 canned responses to cover countless problems and permutations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Over 4 months, I ended up resolving 2,148 tickets for our customers and with my canned responses, I resolved them faster than ever.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-09-06-videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/nice-message.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Videostream Support Email #781: One of the better emails I found waiting for me in Freshdesk one morning.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through reading positive feedback I started to understand why customers loved Videostream so much. As I wrote sales copy, I could reference customer testimonials and highlight the features that they were most excited about. Many loved the funny tips screens that had jokes and referenced that our team was just 6 guys in Canada. This confirmed that the Videostream personality that resonated with users should be part of all future sales copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t have written as effective sales copy if I hadn&amp;#39;t spent the time to understand our customers: their frustrations, their joys, and their dreams for Videostream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Building a Split Test Winning Website&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Videostream team had reached a consensus: the website was long due for a makeover and I would lead development on a full redesign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-09-06-videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/vs-old-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Original Videostream Website&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started brainstorming what I the ideal new website would be like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It would be easier to understand what was Videostream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hero images would showcase how Videostream worked with laptops, TVs, iPhones and Android devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Descriptions would quickly address frequently emailed questions like: &amp;quot;will Videostream play my videos?&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first focused on the &amp;quot;above the fold&amp;quot; content, or what a visitor would see before they scrolled. As I bounced between different drafts for the subtitle, I realized that using a word substitution animation would allow us to subtly show just how many files we supported. With a simple Javascript animation, &amp;quot;The easiest way to stream ____ from your computer...&amp;quot; would animate the blank to say: videos, MP4s, MKVs, AVIs, MP3s... switching every 4 seconds. This instantly addressed above the fold the question: &amp;quot;will Videostream play my videos?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To stay consistent with the app&amp;#39;s existing design style, I found a great Material Design HTML/CSS/JS framework to build on (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.materialup.com/posts/mdlp-material-design-landing-page&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). I got to work on customizations and generating the Hero image assets in Photoshop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraging my knowledge from leading sites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://copyhackers.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Copyhackers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://moz.com/blog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.kissmetrics.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kissmetrics&lt;/a&gt;, I focused all visitors towards a single Call to Action (CTA) above the fold: the &amp;quot;Get Streaming&amp;quot; download button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-09-06-videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/vs-home-c.png&quot; alt=&quot;New Site Hero: The view above the fold any visitor to GetVideostream.com will see. Notice the singular focus on quickly describing what is Videostream, and pushing visitors to download.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I continued writing sales copy, I focused on consistency with the Videostream personality customers already loved. For Features and FAQs, I leveraged all I had read in customer emails what they loved most about Videostream, and questions that kept coming up. I also maintained consistency repeating certain phrases in headings and text to better target certain keywords we wanted to take in Google rankings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-09-06-videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/vs-features-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New Features Section: Using customer testimonials, I could accurately prioritize which features people loved the most and which benefit resonated best.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few quick weeks of development, my new website was ready to go head to head with the old site. With consistently high web traffic, we could make a statistically significant call on which site was the winner in under a week. &lt;strong&gt;Pretty soon we could see a trend. The new website was seriously rocking the numbers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;65% of visitors to the new website downloaded Videostream, up from 54% on the old website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the new website, I put CTA download buttons after every section. Now we would know which content led people to download. Though most people downloaded just from the Hero section above the fold, close to 20% of downloads were coming from Features, Testimonials, and FAQ sections. Those downloads would have never happened on the old website which relied on a single CTA and a lot less content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After beating the old site in spilt tests, the new site was pushed to 100% of traffic. We were excited for the spike in downloads that would come for a higher conversion rate but were surprised what we saw when we logged into Google Analytics the following week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-09-06-videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/weekly-active-users2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Videostream App Usage Data: Weekly active users with the old website, and the 12% jump from the new website.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were shocked when weekly active users shot up 12%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within a week of the new website launching, weekly active users in the app shot up 12%. They&amp;#39;ve since stayed high and been one of the biggest single growth jumps we had this summer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out many people were going to the main website to launch Videostream which meant that our huge boost came not only from new downloads, but from bringing existing users back more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My vision for a conversion focused website had worked! Download conversions were up on many metrics up to 32% and weekly active users had received a 12% boost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next project...increasing revenue!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A Premium Flow Focused on Revenue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My internship was almost done. I had answered a lot of email and developed a new split test beating website. The team now was curious to see what I could do with their primary revenue funnel: the Premium flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-09-06-videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/premo1-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Old Premium Flow: Features &amp;amp; Plans.&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-09-06-videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/premo2-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Old Premium Flow: Payment Confirmation.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current upgrade process was a bit convoluted. Most interactions such as changing a plan or choosing a payment required a separate page and a number of clicks. From customer emails, I knew that even with the features descriptions front and centre, most still had no idea what they would be getting with Premium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My priorities with the new Premium flow ended up being very similar to what I settled on for the website previously:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write sales copy based on customer feedback with the much loved Videostream personality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow Material Design guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make Premium benefits easier to understand&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let people buy Premium in fewer clicks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a lot of research from e-commerce checkout white papers to successful upgrade flows in other apps. I built the premium flow from scratch with HTML/CSS/Sass, Stripe API, PayPal integration, and Javascript. I&amp;#39;m so thankful to the team for all they taught me about coding for a Chrome App.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-09-06-videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/premflow1-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New Premium Flow: Plans, Payment Selection, &amp;amp; Features.&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-09-06-videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/premflow2-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;New Premium Flow: Payment Confirmation.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Premium flow was almost in production as I finished my internship at Videostream. The benefits of Videostream were now easy to understand. Upgrading was fast and seamless and could be done in fewer clicks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Premium flow is in split tests now where it is rumoured to be winning and generating more revenue for Videostream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Growth? Check, check, and check&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Videostream, I leveraged my primary task of email support to better understand our customers and spur growth in different parts of our funnel. The new website increased download conversions by up to 32% on most metrics. We improved user retention with weekly active users growing by 12%. Revenue is now going up thanks to a more effective Premium flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I grew a lot. The experience of owning a project, working closely with founders, collaborating with a crazy good technical team, and supporting thousands of customers was priceless. I learned so much. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thankful to Matt, Jason, Graham, Joe, Phillip, Sean, &amp;amp; Rahul for all of the support, guidance, and unique opportunities I received this summer. It&amp;#39;s certainly one I won&amp;#39;t soon forget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.S. I&amp;#39;m looking to do an internship next summer too! If you think I&amp;#39;d be a good fit on your team, check out my &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewparadi.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Resume-Sept-2015-v4.6.1b.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;resume&lt;/a&gt; and send me an email at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:me@andrewparadi.com&quot;&gt;me@andrewparadi.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Canadian Fintech Startups Have Only 3 Options</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Assembled on July 7th were the Chief Digital Officers of Canada&amp;#39;s biggest banks (TD, CIBC, BMO, and Scotiabank) to discuss financial technology startups (fintech) at Communitech. Clearer than ever was the truth that though there&amp;#39;s lots of problems in Canadian banking ripe for disruption by startups, the opportunity is very limited. Canadian banks can&amp;#39;t innovate and are on the prowl for the startups that can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Update: Globe &amp; Mail Finance Reporter Agrees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long time finance reporter for the Globe &amp;amp; Mail agreed that fintech startups will be significantly cut out from truly disrupting the Canadian banks in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Andrew_Paradi&quot;&gt;@Andrew_Paradi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/globeinvestor&quot;&gt;@globeinvestor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Uber&quot;&gt;@uber&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#10;Not banking, but maybe borrowing for clientele that can&amp;#39;t access a home-equity line of credit.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rob Carrick (@rcarrick) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/rcarrick/status/634722889548365824&quot;&gt;August 21, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Slow Banks will be Slow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost every answer from the CDOs of TD, CIBC, BMO, and Scotiabank was laced with the underlying reality that innovation would not come from within their organizations. Bureaucratic corporate cultures, intense federal regulation, a buyers market in bank competition, and slow advances into Canada from external technologies make innovation a unique challenge for the Canadian banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire panel of CDOs knew the features that consumers wanted whether it was easier transfers to other people, contactless payments, or more powerful mobile apps. Yet they had few explanations for why these relatively simple fixes for an awful banking experience weren&amp;#8217;t already in place. &lt;a href=&quot;https://squareup.com/ca&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Square&lt;/a&gt; has solved easy transfers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/apple-pay/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apple Pay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://officialandroid.blogspot.ca/2015/05/pay-your-way-with-android.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Android Pay&lt;/a&gt; standardize the most convenient payment technologies yet. And you only need to give &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mint.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mint&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.acorns.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Acorns&lt;/a&gt; a try to understand just how much the bank&amp;#8217;s online and mobile experiences could improve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-07-27-canadian-fintech-startups-have-only-3-options/Portfolio-Allocation-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Acorns investing for iOS &amp;amp; Android: both gorgeous design and an innovative approach to investing. Both of which you won&amp;#39;t find in big bank apps. &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#39;https://www.acorns.com/&amp;#39; target=&amp;#39;_blank&amp;#39;&amp;gt;https://www.acorns.com/&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks whether limited by regulation, Apple Pay&amp;#8217;s rollout schedule, or &amp;#8220;design by committee&amp;#8221; internal bureaucracy, are desperate for startups to do the innovation that they can&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Banks Want to Become Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine a world where all transaction data on what, where, when, how, (and possibly even why) you buy was leveraged by the banks to target you for their services, new products, or even sold through an API to other companies. Currently this only happens on a limited scale by individual retailers who collect and leverage data in loyalty programs and to manage inventory (think PC Points or the recommendations you get on Amazon).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this future envisioned by the banks, they would singularly hold all of your purchase information. What we&amp;#8217;ve seen from loyalty programs so far would just be the tip of the iceberg for the types of personalization that would be possible with the banks&amp;#8217; information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you thought PC Points offering you 200pts to eat a dozen bananas was too personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel reiterated over and over how important the analysis of transaction information and banking data is to their strategy. The banks don&amp;#8217;t just want to become commoditized transaction intermediaries like VISA or MasterCard. They want to become APIs for consumer purchasing information, so entrenched in the space that they can&amp;#8217;t be disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks already collect and store these mountains of data, they just need ways to pull out insights while keeping a balance between personalization and privacy. The opportunity for fintech startups to solve this problem is huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Tremors of Disruption in Words Unsaid&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about their 5 year forecast for Canadian banks one CDO mused that &amp;#8220;of course in &lt;em&gt;5 years&lt;/em&gt; we will still have brick &amp;amp; mortar branches.&amp;#8221; Implicitly, he points to a potentially inevitable time when there are banks that don&amp;#8217;t have branches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-07-27-canadian-fintech-startups-have-only-3-options/brick-mortar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Brick &amp;amp;amp; mortar bank branches may fade over the long term but aren&amp;#39;t going anywhere according to the Canadian banking executives.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tangerine (formerly ING Direct) was the first glimmer of a future where opening accounts, transferring funds, and investing could all be done easily online without dealing with any bank staff. A bank that had a user experience as easy and pain-free as Uber would certainly attract my business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, unlike the transportation bylaws that Uber lobbies against, Canadian banking regulations would be significantly more difficult for an innovator to overcome. Federal regulation instead of local bylaws would render a divide and conquer &lt;a href=&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/27/9035731/future-of-uber-regulation-illegal-violations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;city by city attack&lt;/a&gt; useless. Where Uber could simply skip &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/nevada-bans-uber-2014-11&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Las&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/27/9035731/future-of-uber-regulation-illegal-violations&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vegas&lt;/a&gt; and move onto another city when lawsuits made Uber illegal, the dodging whack-a-mole routine doesn&amp;#8217;t work when lawsuits and judgements come down at a federal level. Simply ask &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/25/5842524/what-does-the-aereo-ruling-mean-for-television&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aereo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-07-27-canadian-fintech-startups-have-only-3-options/tangerine.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Even innovative upstart ING Direct with strong online-first banking growth over a decade still ended in acquisition. Scotiabank acquired ING Direct for over $3.1 billion in 2012 and rebranded it as Tangerine soon after. Feature advances have stalled since purchase.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tangerine was only possible because established bank, ING, expanded into Canada in 1997 with enough resources to deal with the regulation. With expansive established business around the world, they could pay to get over the regulatory hurdles keeping them from Canadian customers. Most startups will never start with a war chest big enough to get past the regulation to truly disrupt the banking experience in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Three Options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disruption in banking is limited, internal bank innovation nearly impossible, so the banks need fintech startups more than ever. Canadian fintech startups now need to live with the fact that the odds for building a sustainable company in Canadian banking are even longer than imagined. The way I see it, there are three options for Canadian fintech: build a nimble firm and accept limited market growth opportunity, make the irrational assumption of founding a startup solely for acquisition, or dare to do the impossible; disrupt the Canadian banks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My Favourite 6 Books Since January</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I purchased my Kobo Aura on Boxing Day 2014 and decided I would be more diligent in my leisure reading this year. 6 months in, these are the 6 books that I would most recommend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;David &amp; Goliath - Malcolm Gladwell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-06-12-leisure-reading-part-1/Gladwell_David-and-Goliath.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Gladwell&amp;#39;s books have always intrigued me since I read about 10,000 hours to success in &lt;strong&gt;Outliers&lt;/strong&gt; in grade 9. &lt;strong&gt;David &amp;amp; Goliath&lt;/strong&gt; obliterates some of the most closely held beliefs about how diminishing returns really play out in society. As seems to be Malcolm&amp;#39;s style, each chapter digs deep into a single story as it relate&amp;#39;s to the book&amp;#39;s overarching theme. It certainly gave me a lot to think about across countless areas including:
- Are smaller class sizes always the best investment to improve education?
- Is it better long term to study at prestigious or less competitive university?
- Could the children of the very rich be as disadvantaged as the children of the very poor?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;script id=&quot;infogram_0_how_society_really_works&quot; src=&quot;//e.infogr.am/js/embed.js?tdf&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;width:100%;border-top:1px solid #acacac;padding-top:3px;font-family:Arial;font-size:10px;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https://infogr.am/how_society_really_works&quot; style=&quot;color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;&quot;&gt;How Society Really Works&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a style=&quot;color:#acacac;text-decoration:none;&quot; href=&quot;https://infogr.am&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Create infographics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I approach many policy issues more skeptically now. More money and resources will not always make things better when many aspects of society play out as Laffer curves and not traditional logarithmic diminishing returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Rosie Project - Graeme C. Simsion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-06-12-leisure-reading-part-1/The-Rosie-Project.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
While I was reading this book, it was all I could talk about. Maybe I&amp;#39;m just a sucker for a classic love story but I agree with Bill Gates (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/6-Books-I-Would-Recommend-Summer-Reading&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Rosie-Effect&quot; taget=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) that this book is different. The book tells the tale of a biology professor with undiagnosed Aspergers syndrome that sets out on a journey to find the perfect wife by getting women to fill out a survey. Simsion did an unbelievable job writing the perfect internal thoughts of a near purely logical mind (and I found myself laughing as I admitted to myself that I shared many thought processes with a supposedly undiagnosed Aspergers professor). I very rarely read fiction but the The Rosie Project made me want to again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. As with most things, the sequel isn&amp;#39;t as good as the original but the Rosie Effect is still worth the read. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Related books I enjoyed:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://craphound.com/littlebrother/download/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Little Brother - Cory Doctorow (Free download!)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; It was just as exciting to read now as it was when I first read it in grade 9. For anybody who&amp;#39;s been reading about Edward Snowden and the disintegrating state of privacy in society, this fiction set in the near future seems closer to reality with each passing year. Looking forward to an encryption key swap with all of you soon!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Autobiography of Malcolm X - Malcolm X &amp; Alex Haley&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-06-12-leisure-reading-part-1/Autobiography-Of-Malcolm-X-The.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malcolm X grew up like many African American males. He went through the foster system, spent his youth in the ghetto, hustled drugs in Harlem, and ended up in jail. Yet these undistinguishable formative years are what make the rest of his life so profound. He overcome religious cults to become a widely known and respected civil rights and community leader in Harlem. His powerful, passionate speeches live on in recordings and videos today long past his assassination in February 1965.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One sentiment shared repeatedly throughout the book was his belief that the desegregationist civil rights protestors like Martin Luther King Jr. weren&amp;#39;t going to affect lasting change, but could simply tackle surface issues. Repeal of Jim Crow laws, integrated busses, integrated schools, the Civil Rights Act of 1964... &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/05/the-case-for-reparations/361631/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it was all just lipstick on a pig&lt;/a&gt;. Fundamental complex race problems couldn&amp;#39;t be dealt with simply with integration and legislation. As we continue to see the racially charged police abuses in Ferguson &amp;amp; Baltimore, and the silent discriminating economic issues around education funding, health care access, and poverty rates, I have begun to understand that &amp;quot;radical&amp;quot; Malcolm may not have been so radical after all. &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/fby2koTK4lY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;We shall overcome&lt;/a&gt;, but we certainly have not yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Related books I enjoyed:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbroken - Laura Hillenbrand:&lt;/strong&gt; Gave me much better insight into the Pacific Theatre of World War II and Louie&amp;#39;s determination was genuinely inspiring. As with most things, this book was better than the 2014 movie directed by Angelina Jolie.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Meaning of Marriage - Tim Keller&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-06-12-leisure-reading-part-1/meaning-marriage-tim-keller.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;
Though I&amp;#39;m many years away from ever exchanging rings, Tim&amp;#39;s book speaks wisdom to single, unmarried, and married couples. I found his strong use of data from research studies paired with Biblical references a better approach than most relationship books that just pull from the author&amp;#39;s personal experience and secular anecdotes. My favourite two pieces of data paraphrased were:
- The vast majority of the 45% divorce rate are those who marry before 18, are high school drop outs, or have a a baby together before marrying. &lt;strong&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t fall into those categories, your chances of a successful marriage are very high.&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hookingupsmart.com/2012/06/13/relationshipstrategies/your-chances-of-divorce-may-be-much-lower-than-you-think/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;)
- Over 60% of marriages are described as &amp;#39;very happy&amp;#39;, over 66% of unhappy marriages will become happy within five years if the people stay married and don&amp;#39;t get divorced.(&lt;a href=&quot;http://americanvalues.org/catalog/pdfs/does_divorce_make_people_happy.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;Perseverance pays off even more often than I thought.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Related books I enjoyed:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things I Wish I&amp;#39;d Known Before We Got Married - Gary Chapman:&lt;/strong&gt; Gary covers the 5 Love Languages, dealing with in-laws, and other practical issues that often come up in the first couple years. Short but worthwhile read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Prodigal God - Tim Keller:&lt;/strong&gt; Tim examines how the classic parable in Luke 15:11-32 is such a powerful expose of how powerful God&amp;#39;s love is and how contrary to societal expectations it is even today.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/timothy-keller-podcast/id352660924?mt=2&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tim Keller Podcast - Tim Keller&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This has been my go to podcast while I&amp;#39;ve been working out. Tim masterfully weaves philosophical and Biblical ideas together into thought provoking talks. The most convicting ones I&amp;#39;ve listened to so far have been &amp;quot;Your Plans: God&amp;#39;s Plans&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Praying our Fears&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Praying our Tears&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Hard Thing About Hard Things - Ben Horowitz&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-06-12-leisure-reading-part-1/hard-things-ben-horowitz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand down, this is the most practical management book I&amp;#39;ve ever read.&lt;/strong&gt; Written with the brevity of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paul Graham&lt;/a&gt; but interspersed with rap lyrics, Ben Horowitz (startup founder, CEO, and famous VC) dishes on how to effectively manage a startup. I valued the lessons and perspective he had from over a decade building a startup, IPO-ing during the Dotcom crash of 2000, and building Opsware into a massive IT software business that was acquired by  HP for $1.6 billion in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on Teknically, certain aspects were always easy to identify as potential causes of our failure. After reading Hard Things, it is so much easier to pinpoint what specifically went wrong and what I will do differently in a new startup. &lt;strong&gt;This book is simply the most practical, must read for any startup founder.&lt;/strong&gt; It succeeds Zero to One as my must-read recommendation for anybody in startups right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Losing the Signal - Jacquie McNish &amp; Sean Silcoff&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-06-12-leisure-reading-part-1/losin_the_signal_mcnish.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought Losing the Signal on Kobo days after it came out and &lt;strong&gt;was finished reading it within 10 days.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#39;s the riveting account of Mike Lazaridis, Jim Balsille, RIM&amp;#39;s hard fought rise to dominance in the smartphone industry they invented, and their precipitous fall we have all witnessed in the past 6 years. There are two reasons why I found this book so difficult to put down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, reading of how RIM was built right here in Waterloo where I work, live, and study was like reading my own family history. So much of the Kitchener Waterloo tech scene has been impacted by RIM and built by former RIM employees. So many different businesses and locations mentioned in the book I recognized or had been to myself, it became so easy and surreal to visualize these thrilling events that happened so close to where I live. &lt;strong&gt;Understanding the story of RIM is fundamental in many ways to understanding the story of the Kitchener Waterloo tech scene.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;Losing the Signal&lt;/strong&gt; provided the inside story of what went wrong. Having just read &lt;strong&gt;The Hard Thing About Hard Things&lt;/strong&gt;, I more precisely could identify the management debt that grew so large that even if the iPhone hadn&amp;#39;t disrupted the smartphone industry, RIM still would not have been in good shape. Leo Tolstoy writes &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; I think the same is true for startup success. Every unsuccessful startup is unsuccessful in its own way. There were certain aspects of RIM&amp;#39;s downward spiral that I immediately recognized because at Teknically we had unsuccessfully dealt with the same issue. Yet many others were unique to RIM. In both cases it can be depressing to dwell on what could have been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Epilogue, Jim Balsille grew increasingly frustrated as he recalled his final years at RIM where he had pushed for a focus on software &amp;amp; services (specifically cross platform BBM). His plan was dismissed by Mike Lazaridis, the board, and was later shuttered by RIM&amp;#39;s next CEO, Thorsten Heins. After Jim resigned, he watched Facebook acquire WhatsApp for $22 billion, Kik and weChat continue to explode, and the messaging, software &amp;amp; services market prove to be more promising than almost every hardware company other than Apple and Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pride and ignorant optimism let RIM&amp;#39;s management believe that new smart phones and QNX powered Blackberry 10 would save them. To know the clear promise of Jim&amp;#39;s BBM software &amp;amp; services strategy and yet see how viciously it was pushed aside is, for me, the most profound indication of RIM management&amp;#39;s misunderstanding of the new world ushered in by the iPhone. &lt;strong&gt;A market where apps are more important than battery life, design matters more than productivity, and cloud services are better consumer lock in than a perfect hardware keyboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Next Reads&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 12 books done in 6 months, I&amp;#39;m on track for a book every two weeks. Right now I&amp;#39;m working on:
- &lt;strong&gt;Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future by Ashlee Vance&lt;/strong&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;The Hobbit by J. R. R. Tolkien&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how busy you feel you are, it&amp;#39;s always the right time to start investing in yourself by reading. I never set out to reach a certain number but Im glad that I stuck with reading for fun this year. The dividends continue to pay out in my life and I hope the same for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

        <title>Fred &amp; Ted: Uber&#39;s Disruption is Delusional</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three key insights on Uber, when to drop out, and valuations from Communitech&amp;#39;s fireside chat with renowned VC Fred &amp;amp; CEO Ted.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Woah who&amp;#39;s Fred &amp;amp; Ted?!&lt;/strong&gt; Fred Wilson is a very well known Venture Capitalist and Co-Founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usv.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Union Square Ventures&lt;/a&gt; (funded Twitter, Tumblr, Etsy, Kik...). Ted Livingston is Founder/CEO of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kik.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kik&lt;/a&gt;, currently the messaging app of choice for over 200 million people. As an early investor in Kik, Fred &amp;amp; Ted have built a strong working relationship and it was remarkable to have both of them sit down to share their perspective with a chat moderated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://velocity.uwaterloo.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt; Director Mike Kirkup. Three parts of the chat stood out for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Disruption is Delusional&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anybody reading the news over the past two years has seen the controversies as a result of two companies disrupting the transportation and accommodation sectors respectively: &lt;strong&gt;Uber &amp;amp; Airbnb. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-05-11-fred-ted/airbnb-nyc-poster.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Defaced Airbnb Poster in New York City, July 2014.  Photo: &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#39;http://d.fastcompany.net/multisite_files/fastcompany/poster/2014/07/3033191-poster-p-1-airbnb-ads-guerilla-vigilante.jpg&amp;#39; target=&amp;#39;_blank&amp;#39;&amp;gt;FastCompany&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From most recently a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/calgary-home-in-ruins-after-airbnb-nightmare/article24182387/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;drug-induced orgy&amp;quot; at an Airbnb in Calgary&lt;/a&gt; to an &lt;a href=&quot;http://valleywag.gawker.com/uber-calls-womans-20-mile-nightmare-abduction-an-ineff-1645819700&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Uber driver kidnapping a woman&lt;/a&gt;, entire sites have sprung up devoted to frightening tales including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.airbnbhell.com/airbnb-guest-stories/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;airbnbHell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href&quot;http://www.ubertrocity.com/top-10-uber-horror-stories/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UberTrocity&lt;/a&gt;. These companies have tried to combat horror stories with self-justifying &lt;a href=&quot;http://pando.com/2012/10/24/travis-shrugged/?utm_content=buffera9b1c&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ayn Rand philosophies&lt;/a&gt; instilled into employees and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/14/5896785/hey-new-york-airbnb-wants-to-get-you-in-bed&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; persuasive marketing campaigns&lt;/a&gt; to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked about his thoughts on these companies, Fred didn&amp;#39;t let them off the hook:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There are things that Airbnb has facilitated that aren&amp;#39;t good things.  I&amp;#39;m not an investor in them so I can admit it. [...] I think the same thing is true for some ride sharing services. [...] We ought to admit it&amp;#39;s not a good thing. We ought to start to have a conversation with people about how we can put the proper controls in place so that these services are used in ways that are helpful, and are not used in ways that are harmful.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet despite the horrific situations that users have found themselves in, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://upstart.bizjournals.com/entrepreneurs/hot-shots/2014/11/05/travis-kalanicks-take-no-prisoners-startup.html?page=all&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-02-20/uber-leads-taxi-industry-disruption-amid-fight-for-riders-drivers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;claim&lt;/a&gt; that this is simply the price of &lt;em&gt;disruption&lt;/em&gt;. I have used both services and they indeed are radically better than their &amp;quot;old economy&amp;quot; equivalents. It can become easy to justify the horrific experiences of some users as simply an unfortunate &lt;em&gt;cost of doing business&lt;/em&gt; in the shared economy. Yet, Fred wasn&amp;#39;t silent on the valley culture of &lt;em&gt;disruption&lt;/em&gt; worship:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t like when people in my business or in the startup sector are blindly like &amp;#39;We&amp;#39;re disruptors!&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Screw those people, we&amp;#39;re making the world better!&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Get off our back&amp;#39;. It&amp;#39;s not really true. There&amp;#39;s always some harm when you build something new and it does, I think, make sense to have a conversation about what the rules of the game should be to make sure that things are safe and things are done properly.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fred&amp;#39;s remarks struck a chord with me in his balanced approach to the need for &lt;strong&gt;reasonable yet protective&lt;/strong&gt; regulation in the new sharing economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Don&#39;t Choose to Drop Out, Wait for the Startup to Force You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question that was brought up by Velocity Director Mike Kirkup and that echoes frequently in the minds of student entrepreneurs is &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;how do I know if I should drop out?&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;. We asked ourselves this a lot prior to pulling the plug and &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewparadi.com/2014/10/the-389-day-laurier-bba/&quot;&gt;deferring classes&lt;/a&gt; in Fall 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-05-11-fred-ted/ted-livingston-kik-phone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Ted with early Kik apps after raising his Series A in 2011. Photo: &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#39;http://betakit.com/39411/&amp;#39; target=&amp;#39;_blank&amp;#39;&amp;gt;BetaKit&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike many entrepreneurs (myself included) who sometimes seem like they&amp;#39;re looking for a reason to drop out, Ted stayed in school as long as he could. &lt;strong&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t drop out of University of Waterloo until Kik was raising a $1 million seed funding round.&lt;/strong&gt; At that point, his investors wouldn&amp;#39;t sign unless he dropped out to work full time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and Mike chimed in about the world leading talent pool at University of Waterloo and opportunities to do startups without giving up the safety net of university. All three on stage reiterated that you shouldn&amp;#39;t start a startup to simply start a startup, wait for the right idea and work at other startups until then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having gone through many of these realizations over &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/lessons-from-behind-the-curtain/&quot;&gt;my journey with Teknically&lt;/a&gt;, I couldn&amp;#39;t agree more with the panel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t drop out until you absolutely have to. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t start a startup just to start a startup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;#39;t take for granted the safety net of being a university student, make the most of it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Let the Valuation Choose You&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few minutes of the talk, Fred was asked about how to choose an initial valuation for fundraising rounds. He proceeded to dish out one of the simplest mathematical methods I&amp;#39;ve heard. (If the following section seems a bit confusing, try this &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/EHzvmyMJEK4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;How to Start a Startup lecture&lt;/a&gt;, if it seems too simple check out the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470929820/domofa-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Venture Deals&lt;/a&gt; by Brad Feld)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most entrepreneurs initially want to optimize for a high valuation when raising money. This mentality stems from the desire to give less of their company away for the same amount of money. Fred reiterated that this is optimizing for the wrong thing. Instead of simply of choosing a big valuation and trying to justify it, he suggested to focus on three more important areas to easily determine a reasonable valuation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much do you want to give away?&lt;/strong&gt; Each round plan to give 10-20% of the company away, but don&amp;#39;t go too much over 20% or later rounds will become very difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much do you need?&lt;/strong&gt; At least 12 months of runway. More than 18 may make the round difficult to raise and harder for next one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose the right investors.&lt;/strong&gt; At the end of the day who your investors are matter more than valuation, you&amp;#39;ll be married to them most likely for the lifespan of the company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calculate your valuation simply: &lt;br/&gt;Valuation = 12-18 month burn / 10-20% equity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Example A&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raising (burn)&lt;/strong&gt; $20,000 x 12 months = $240,000 &lt;strong&gt;for (equity)&lt;/strong&gt; 10-20%.
&lt;strong&gt;Valuation&lt;/strong&gt; = $240,000 / 0.2 to $240,000/0.1 = $1.2 million to $2.4 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Example B&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raising&lt;/strong&gt; $50,000 x 18 months = $900,000 &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; 15%
&lt;strong&gt;Valuation&lt;/strong&gt; = $900,000 / 0.15 = $6 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fred&amp;#39;s simple math makes choosing a ballpark valuation almost too easy. We now have no excuse for getting sucked into an valuation inflation spiral (I&amp;#39;m looking at you &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/a9ToqUSfkv8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Silicon Valley&lt;/a&gt; Season 2 Episode 1)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Last Words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fireside Chats = Free learning from legends (usually worth the hype, don&amp;#39;t let doubts stop you from showing up!)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Innovation in the 6</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thousands of entrepreneurs, researchers, policy makers, and community organizations coming together to celebrate and foster innovation in Ontario. On April 27th, I went to OCE Discovery 2015 in Toronto.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Founder&#39;s Forum with a Dragon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2014, Teknically (see part &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-dream-fades/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) was approved for $30,000 in Ontario Centres of Excellence (OCE) SmartStart funding. The funding allowed us to work full time developing Webplio for small business owners in Ontario and around the world in Fall 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year in April, OCE hosts the Discovery conference at the Toronto Metro Convention Centre to celebrate the innovation that funded companies have produced in the past year. I attended to represent Teknically at the exclusive Founder&amp;#39;s Forum event before the conference opened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-04-29-innovation-in-the-6/Croxon_Bruce.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bruce Croxon: Founder of Lavalife, Dragon on Dragon&amp;#39;s Den Season 6-8. Photo: &amp;lt;a href=&amp;#39;http://www.techvibes.com/blog/why-bruce-croxon-dragons-den-2014-03-17&amp;#39; target=&amp;#39;_blank&amp;#39;&amp;gt;TechVibes&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bruce Croxon anchored the event with an initial talk and panel discussion afterwards. He seemed very down to earth and honest in ways I hadn&amp;#39;t heard before from other entrepreneurs. One thing he said stood out for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he looks back on the 16 years building Lavalife until it&amp;#39;s $180 million acquisition, he doesn&amp;#39;t know whether he would recommend becoming an entrepreneur to his young children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most entrepreneurs I&amp;#39;ve heard always say something along the lines of &amp;quot;well, there were ups and downs but at the end of the day I&amp;#39;d do it all again&amp;quot;. Of course what Bruce said is up to interpretation, &lt;strong&gt;but&lt;/strong&gt; I think it hints at the truth that &lt;strong&gt;money isn&amp;#39;t everything.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sacrificing often over a decade to build a startup isn&amp;#39;t just long hours and high stress at low compensation. It&amp;#39;s the lost opportunities to enjoy your youth, travel, build a family, or simply have any type of balance in your life. For a few entrepreneurs like Bruce, all of this leads to a huge acquisition payout or equity worth millions. &lt;strong&gt;For most it doesn&amp;#39;t. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know first hand how quickly a startup can take over your life. &lt;strong&gt;In Fall 2014, I was easily clocking 12-16 hour days, sometimes longer.&lt;/strong&gt; I thrived with the fast pace and enjoyed the hard work we were doing but I can say now I&amp;#39;m thankful it ended when it did. I love my family, friends, and enjoy salsa dancing, piano, guitar, and reading. All of these were sacrificed in part or whole while I was building a startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Bruce, I&amp;#39;m not sure I would make that sacrifice again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Second most profound insight from Bruce: &amp;quot;Nobody changes past the age of 11. Don&amp;#39;t hire or do anything assuming people will change&amp;quot;. Real.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;BOSI: Discovering I&#39;m a Builder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In first year BBA at Laurier students test their emotional intelligence with DISC, EQI, Myers–Briggs, and any number of other tests. Most of these are very broad in scope and just provide general insights into who you are and who you are best suited to work with on a team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a breakout session at Discovery, I learned about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bosidna.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BOSI&lt;/a&gt;: the test to determine your Entrepreneurial DNA. It gave me a much clearer understanding of situations in which I thrive and blind spots that can hold me back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fsU9N6A18sY?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Entrepreneurial DNA&amp;quot; annotation=&amp;quot;BOSI Creator, Joe Abraham, speaking at TedxBend. Alt link: &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/fsU9N6A18sY&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/fsU9N6A18sY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to BOSI, the four types of entrepreneurs are (by % of total entrepreneurs):
- &lt;strong&gt;15%   Builder&lt;/strong&gt;: High scale &amp;amp; sustainable, mostly $5+ million businesses, controlling. Decision Lens: infrastructure. Biggest struggle: relationships. &lt;strong&gt;Given example: Donald Trump.&lt;/strong&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;30% Opportunist&lt;/strong&gt;: Right place = ground floor, willing to get on any rocket, optimistic, multiple personal revenue streams. Decision lens: financial freedom. Biggest struggle: focus. &lt;strong&gt;Given example: Richard Branson.&lt;/strong&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;42% Specialist&lt;/strong&gt;: Expert, single industry. Decision lens: reputation. Biggest struggle: lead generation. &lt;strong&gt;Given example: Bill Gates.&lt;/strong&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;13% Innovator&lt;/strong&gt;: Mad scientist, aha moment, in the lab, limitless IP. Decision lens: impact/mission. Biggest struggle: operations. &lt;strong&gt;Given example: Mark Zuckerberg.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking my own assessment it was clarifying to recognize that my primary DNA type was Builder and secondary was Opportunist. Looking back on my favourite aspects of positions in clubs, organizations, and Teknically, they were all situations in which a Builder would thrive. They were situations in which I thrived.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSI gave me a new lens to view other entrepreneurs and myself. It also provided some initial ideas on how I can find opportunities better suited to my strengths. You can take the ten question test yourself &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bosidna.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;d highly recommend taking the two minutes to fill it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Real Networking&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody always talks about networking especially at business schools. The focus is always on how networking can land you the dream job, help you meet famous business people, or give you connections to power. I think much of this encourages an approach that is self-centered and doesn&amp;#39;t provide either person value. It simply leads to constant self-promotion and business card exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with most things in life, I&amp;#39;ve begun to learn first hand that serving others is much better than serving yourself. At Discovery it was awesome to reconnect with entrepreneurs and mentors I&amp;#39;ve met along my journey in the KW Tech community. It was even cooler to sit and talk with entrepreneurs I hadn&amp;#39;t met before and learn how they are innovating in areas from an &lt;a href=&quot;http://dymaxiainc.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;anxiety alert system for people with autism&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shocklock.ca/#/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;car maintenance safety hardware&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I wasn&amp;#39;t working on Webplio anymore, there was no distraction to try and get the person to sign up. I was able to listen and think of the best insights or lessons I could share to help them. I can&amp;#39;t speak for others but I found this approach to networking much more rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The State of Innovation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-04-29-innovation-in-the-6/oce-founder-forum.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s an honour to attend these events with so many hard working, down to earth people. I didn&amp;#39;t know what to expect at Discovery but I walked away very impressed with the individuals in many aspects of Ontario&amp;#39;s entrepreneurship ecosystem, the growing synergy between government and startup sector, and the state of innovation in Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am more convinced than ever that Ontario is one of the best places to build a startup. Innovation isn&amp;#39;t confined to &amp;quot;the valley&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s happening right here in KW, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/fxTyS-aqdLE?t=8s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the 6&lt;/a&gt;, and all across Ontario.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>7 Personal Lessons from Founding a Startup</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When people use analogies of your co-founder being like a wife, a startup as your baby, and employees as family, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a surprise to find a startup has a massive effect on your personal life. I founded Teknically three months after I turned 18, so I already was growing at a fast pace becoming an independent adult. Being a founder put me in unique circumstances to force me to grow faster than I would have before. I am the man I am today because of Teknically, here are 7 personal lessons it helped me learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;0: Startup Laurier Chat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9d5snONjSCk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I covered these 7 tips in a talk I did at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/startuplaurier&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Startup Laurier&lt;/a&gt; in January. Unfortunately the camera cut out midway through so I&amp;#39;ve tried to cover below the main points from the talk. Also here are the startup books &amp;amp; resources I mentioned in the talk:
- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;The Essays&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; - Paul Graham
- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470929820/domofa-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Venture Deals&lt;/a&gt; - Brad Feld
- &lt;a href=&quot;http://zerotoonebook.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zero to One&lt;/a&gt; - Peter Thiel
- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.ca/The-Startup-Owners-Manual-Step-By-Step/dp/0984999302&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Startup Owner&amp;#39;s Manual&lt;/a&gt; - Steve Blank &amp;amp; Bob Dorf (Methodology taught at &lt;a href=&quot;http://laurierentrepreneur.ca/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Laurier Launchpad&lt;/a&gt;)
- &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codecademy.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt; - Good beginner programming lessons
- &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeschool.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code School&lt;/a&gt; - Very robust beginner to advanced lessons in almost any language/framework&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1: Two Things About People&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parts &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-dream-fades/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; I give more details about our journey. In short, over 13 months we met hundreds of mentors, student entrepreneurs, experienced founders, and investors. I&amp;#39;m thankful to so many for their support and wisdom that helped us avoid many of the most common mistakes made as founders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said, I also learned two key things about people that I have hinted at in previous posts and talks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;i) Everybody is just human.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no startup superhero founders. Stop worshiping people, it skews self thought about your own capabilities. Success isn&amp;#39;t limited to those with some supernatural ability, it comes down to hard work, perseverance, and a bit of luck. You can do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;ii) People don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about. &lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few people are real experts, even fewer know your business better than you do. We came to realize that even though the mentors and entrepreneurs we met with were clearly intelligent people, nobody had the right answer all the time and some never did. The key was to listen, process, and confidently make decisions whether they aligned with all or none the perspectives we heard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Embrace Reading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In July 2007 I attended a National Speakers Association conference in San Diego and one of the self-made speakers shared a remarkable quote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The average American reads 1 book per year. 
The average millionaire reads 1 book per week.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has always stuck with me and I&amp;#39;ve seen the consequences play out repeatedly when I forget to feed my mind. Read anything, read everything. Over the course of 2014 I averaged one book per month. Since January 2015, I&amp;#39;m up to one book every two weeks, still aiming towards the goal of one book per week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve found the books I&amp;#39;ve read in the past 16 months have kept my mind alert, open to new ideas, and helped me grow as a person (wondering what those books were...find out in an upcoming blog post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with interesting biographies and relevant startup books. I soon branched into non-fiction, history, and even fiction (which I used to rarely read). Start reading with whatever you&amp;#39;re comfortable with and expand after that. Once you make reading fun, learning will be too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. 360º Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In high school I read a book called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/en-ca/books/product/9780310495956-item.html?mkwid=8t6Z3MTe_dc&amp;pcrid=44154474422&amp;s_campaign=goo-Shopping_Books&amp;gclid=Cj0KEQjwl_6oBRDHxNGz6ueJufMBEiQAvm_k_kfLIX93EQO_JNhMc_Wf3Ohg75gStBv7SSBe4pNeJQQaAiva8P8HAQ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Courageous Leadership&lt;/a&gt; by Bill Hybels  that fundamentally changed how I viewed leadership. He successfully proved that business management techniques were just as useful to build a successful church as they were in any organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He suggests in his book that leadership isn&amp;#39;t simple like a straight line. It&amp;#39;s not just leading those below you by setting goals or casting vision; as a team leader, 
club president, or even startup founder. True leadership extends for 360º.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-04-02-7-personal-lessons-from-founding-a-startup/360Leader.png&quot; alt=&quot;Illustration of the 360º Leader (attr: ajoconnor.com).&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It involves leading by example and helpful words nudging in the right direction those beside you; as peers, classmates, or good friends. Leadership includes proving by example a better work ethic, a better way to live, addressing those above you respectfully; your bosses, executives, or elders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really resonated with me though was the revelation that none of these three areas is the most difficult to lead. The most difficult task is leading yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the area where most leaders fall off the path, when they let themselves off the hook, don&amp;#39;t hold themselves to a higher standard, or don&amp;#39;t take the time and energy to keep improving themselves. It can be easy to settle into a complacency and prideful self-righteousness when you don&amp;#39;t lead yourself with the same vigor that you lead others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I have failed, it has almost always been as a result of a failure to lead myself. This failure is unforgiving and like a toxic oil spill, the effects eventually spread to all other areas of your leadership circle and life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to be serious about becoming a great leader, be serious about leading yourself now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Dealing with Failure&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have two distinct memories of becoming overwhelmed by failure in the course of our startup. Both revealed an immovable reliance I had put on success to justify my understanding of who I was as a person. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;i) Laurier Entrepreneurship Competition&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-04-02-7-personal-lessons-from-founding-a-startup/LEC-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In February 2014 we competed in the Laurier Entrepreneurship Competition and blew away the crowd with a very polished presentation. Compared to others who presented in terms of their idea and presentation I was sure without much of any doubt that we would win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the assumption that makes you feel that third place was a failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was shocked and kept desperately wanting to know what did we do wrong? How could we have presented better? Which aspects of our product and business plan weren&amp;#39;t made clear? My parents and others helped me realize that we didn&amp;#39;t do anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life isn&amp;#39;t fair. Judges don&amp;#39;t always pick who should have won. 
The best don&amp;#39;t always win. Just accept it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a while but I have. When we competed later in Halifax and Provo, my mindset going in was very different. I didn&amp;#39;t have any assumption that we would win simply based on being the best, we needed to tailor to the judges. In Halifax we successfully did that and won first place. In Provo, we weren&amp;#39;t as successful. Regardless of the results I was still very happy with how we did, separate from our place in the standings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;ii) Y Combinator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-04-02-7-personal-lessons-from-founding-a-startup/SFstation-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2014, we interviewed unsuccessfully at Y Combinator in Mountain View, California. My reaction then was different. I began to think back over everything we had accomplished; competitions won, mentors impressed, co-op students hired, innovative software designs, overflowing waitlists of customers. Had it all been false positives, had it all been for nothing? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again I was letting the final result determine the binary judgement of the journey. If we had succeeded, the journey was a success; if we had failed, the journey was a failure. I was shortchanging myself by trying to reduce the complexity of our startup journey to a binary result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had succeeded in so many different ways. We had learned so much. No, we didn&amp;#39;t get into Y Combinator. And no, we wouldn&amp;#39;t be continuing the business. But by no means had we failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the greatest legacies of this failure will be not my complete rehabilitation, but the beginning of a new journey to root my self-worth in a foundation that doesn&amp;#39;t sway in the winds of failure or the rising tides of success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Faith&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2015-04-02-7-personal-lessons-from-founding-a-startup/field-cross-c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be honest with you if I didn&amp;#39;t bring this up. Any founder will admit to the anxiety that can sink in late at night or right before an important presentation, the stress that can seem to compound with each day, the doubts of whether this is all going to be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think these feelings are necessarily limited to founders. In life all of us must deal with failures, stress, anxiety, fears, doubts, feelings of inadequacy. Some founders I&amp;#39;ve known have found relief in yoga, meditation, and regular exercise. Though I&amp;#39;ve also found relief in exercise and dance, I&amp;#39;ve only found one cure to these worries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My faith in Jesus Christ has been the rock on which I can stand through the storms of life. In Him I&amp;#39;ve been freed from the chains that held me when I based my self-worth in success and my own abilities. I no longer feel like an addict looking for the next hit of applause, success, or recognition. I no longer feel the need to maintain appearances of having it all put together. I don&amp;#39;t have a monopoly on the right way to live life, so I&amp;#39;m learning to better respect people from all walks of life. We&amp;#39;re each on our own journey, none of us are in a position to judge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I hope each of you finds a strong foundation to build your life upon. Christ is that rock for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Yet a Better Way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending first year at Laurier I&amp;#39;ve seen first hand what so many people do with their free time at this age. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s a stretch to say most of us don&amp;#39;t have kids, full time jobs, or mortgages. At this unique time in our lives don&amp;#39;t you think we might have a greater purpose than just partying?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As university students in the West, we already are among the top &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.globalrichlist.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;0.5-4%&lt;/a&gt; of the world. We are equipped with resources and time that very few people in the world have. I don&amp;#39;t have any perfect answers on what we should be doing, but I feel we must do something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to ignore the facts, to just stay busy with clubs, class, and parties. &lt;strong&gt;Most people don&amp;#39;t get the opportunity to live an easy life. The few of us that do, have the responsibility to not settle for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Five Lessons from Behind the Curtain</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When your world stops spinning, the lights fade, and the silence surrounds you, you can finally think. These past 13 weeks have been the beginning of my next chapter, the regaining of consciousness, &amp;amp; the recovery from 13 months founding a startup.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This third instalment of the Teknically series transitions from telling our story to sharing the key lessons we learned. Part 3 examines what we learned professionally. Part 4 (coming next week), digs into how founding a startup poured gasoline on my personal development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Pulling Back the Curtain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In parts &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-dream-fades/&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; of this series, I&amp;#39;ve told how over 13 months we&amp;#39;ve been immersed in many aspects of the Kitchener-Waterloo Tech Scene. From Laurier Launchpad to winning national business competitions, Google for Entrepreneurs to managing co-op students and employees, pitching small business owners to interviewing at Y Combinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been immersed in the &amp;quot;Startup Experience&amp;quot; like few our age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our final Laurier Launchpad update presentation we summarized the five biggest lessons we had learned founding Teknically. Check out the video below, or skim the highlights in text. I hope it helps you see behind the curtain that makes startups seem unapproachable for most and only successful for the few.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ilJwvC3H_lk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Andrew and Brandon presenting the final Teknically update at Launchpad, filmed December 16, 2014.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. MVP: The Medium is More Important than the Message&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our original MVP (minimum viable product) was a paper custom report we called the Webplio Snapshot Report. We managed to sell a few of them in January 2014 to local small businesses who were very interested in learning more about their website. We thought this meant we had validated Webplio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We were dead wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/jNR0WyG8Q9/?modal=true&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://scontent-ord1-1.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xpt1/t51.2885-15/e15/1599377_351877598287771_1712167658_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Right MVP, Wrong Medium: In the dead of winter, we sold 10 Webplio Snapshot Reports but it didn&amp;#39;t validate Webplio Dashboard. Medium matters.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came to bringing these initial customers on board to Webplio Dashboard, few were interested. They liked the value of learning more about their website in the medium of a paper report they could hold in their hands. When we changed medium to an online dashboard, none of these initial customers were interested despite it being the same value proposition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t assume you can change customer&amp;#39;s behavior.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had assumed that customers would love the information so much they would be willing to log on and see it on their screen. We were dead wrong in this assumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We realized the MVP must be the same medium as your final product. No alternatives (especially for software).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Speed to MVP is the most important goal. Period.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No business plans, wait lists, A/B testing of marketing, rockstar teams, competitions matter. Nothing matters until you have an MVP with users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We fell into this trap by thinking the Webplio Snapshot Report had validated our MVP requirement. We thought that since we had sold some of our MVP we were okay to move on with other important areas. Retrospectively, I think this was our biggest mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competitions ate up months of time early on that would have been better invested coding code and launching an MVP. If both of us had been coding, we would have reached this goal much faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/lk6PPAG8eu/?modal=true&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://scontent-ord1-1.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xft1/t51.2885-15/e15/11373614_461456450692376_21313322_n.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;We were 1st place winners at CBMC in Halifax but lost focus of our main priority: releasing Webplio as an online MVP.&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The early development stage simply can&amp;#39;t be outsourced outside of the founding team. Somebody needs to know all the code from the beginning. As new members join, they can be the lead in bringing them up to speed and having them understand the vision of the product. This simply isn&amp;#39;t possible if coding in parts or whole is outsourced and contractors change every couple months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, if you&amp;#39;re a business major who thinks your idea is the next Google/Facebook/Snapchat/Uber and all you need is a cheap coder or technical founder to be successful, you are delusional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Execution is worth more than ideas. Learn to code so you can make your product vision a reality. There are no substitutes, no short cuts, and with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codeschool.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Code School&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.codecademy.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt;, and millions of other free resources there are no excuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you&amp;#39;re really serious about your idea, build it. If not, you&amp;#39;re still a wantrepreneur.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Do things that don&#39;t scale.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Webplio Snapshot Report we went straight into building the full Webplio Dashboard. We tried to jump from paper to perfectly scaled web app. What were we thinking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://paulgraham.com/ds.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Do things that don&amp;#39;t scale&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; is a classic piece of PG advice. 
We know now how profound it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should have focused on putting together a hack online MVP and launching as soon as possible. Instead of just entering data manually, we spent months perfecting the Google Analytics integration. Instead of launching with our first front end mockups, we went through numerous internal revisions until we were happy with it. Instead of launching with a basic signup page, we split test wait lists, copy, videos, and marketing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, we had a product too big it was riddled with bugs, too long separated from actual users it wasn&amp;#39;t what they wanted, and a wait list of small businesses and organizations who never got to experience Webplio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Launch your MVP ASAP. Work with users to fix bugs, rework designs, and prioritize features. Scalability should be part of your product vision, but top priority is on getting an MVP to users.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Be your customer, use your competitors.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had never used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kissmetrics.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kissmetrics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://moz.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Moz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://mixpanel.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mixpanel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crazyegg.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CrazyEgg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://taplytics.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Taplytics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://optimizely.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Optimizely&lt;/a&gt; and only primitively used Google Analytics. When we finally did give Optimizely and Mixpanel a try in October 2014 we realized that many problems in analytics had already been solved, and solved really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic YC startup has founders who found a problem while doing their job, decided to solve it with software, reached out to peers and others who had the problem, and boom...scaled to a $100 million dollar company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to that story though is that it was the founders&amp;#39; problem to begin with. They had tried every possible solution. They had built their own hacks. They had lost hours of productivity and hours of sleep to the stress of this problem. They knew the problem best, so they could now solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From our customer interviews, we knew that no small business owner we had talked to had even heard of any competitors to Google Analytics let alone used them. Thus we concluded that we didn&amp;#39;t need to try them either, we would just focus on Google Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had assumed the only power of competing products was just that they had more accurate or real time data. It wasn&amp;#39;t until I started using Optimizely and Mixpanel that I understood just how difficult it would be to build a transformative product on Google Analytics data. We would have no ability in Webplio to show small business owners the data they wanted on call to actions, sales funnels, internal clicks, heat maps, and split testing results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is very possible to be successful by solving someone else&amp;#39;s problem. Your success becomes very unlikely if you don&amp;#39;t take the time to use competing products and understand how your product will be measured against incumbents.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. No founder is a superhero&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had opportunities to meet countless founders of startups in Kitchener-Waterloo, from around the world at the Kairos Global Summit, and even Y Combinator legends President Sam Altman, and founders Jessica Livingston &amp;amp; Trevor Blackwell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/110836607&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Highlight video for Kairos Global Summit, October 2014.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s easy to get sucked into believing the hype... the energy... the disruption... that everybody but you is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting these founders and YC legends in person confirmed something I should have believed inherently: they are not superheros. Everyone no matter how successful is still human. It&amp;#39;s easy to point to Elon Musk, Thomas Edison, and Albert Einstein and say that some people are simply made for greatness. It is true no one could by hard work alone become a Musk, Edison, or Einstein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for the vast majority of other successful people, most have a base level of intelligence, innovation, leadership ability but the key differentiator is hard work and luck. There&amp;#39;s no formula for success, but it certainly isn&amp;#39;t limited to superheros, gods, or existing startup founders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We can all achieve greatness because even theirs is still only that which is possible for man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;In Closing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/_DnKNClu2XM?t=1m45s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;no ragrets&lt;/a&gt;. I wouldn&amp;#39;t change any aspect of our journey, all the lessons I learned will be valuable for the path forward. I see life more clearly and am thankful for the journey and people that have led me here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still learning so I hope you don&amp;#39;t take the above as fact. Take these thoughts, wrestle with them, and determine what you want to believe. Don&amp;#39;t take anything you&amp;#39;re told for granted. Make your own thoughts. Craft your own destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teknically Part 2: The Dream Fades</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two eggs over easy, hash browns, double bacon, ham, sausage, french toast. It&amp;#39;s hard to tell which was the final straw but by the end of lunch on December 2nd, Teknically was finished. We were going back to university. Our startup journey had reached the end.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well I suppose this deserves a bit more explanation. Let&amp;#39;s go back to where we last left off: &amp;quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/&quot;&gt;...let the post-post-secondary adventure begin.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As seemed to be the pattern with our startup journey so far, life without classes didn&amp;#39;t slow down, it only got faster. Within days of signing final deferral paperwork, we had decided to apply for Y Combinator and I already had plans to go to California!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2014-12-24-the-dream-fades/AndrewRitz.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Andrew at the Kairos Global Summit, Ritz-Carlton Laguna Beach October 2014.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Writing with a Dying Pen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing a Y Combinator (YC) application is like trying to write with a dying pen, each letter has a price. As Brandon continued Webplio development at a frantic pace, I began writing our application for the Winter 2015 YC batch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first draft was good by my standards, even my usual family and friend &amp;quot;editors&amp;quot; had little to change. My perspective shifted when we talked to our first YC alumni. In Skype calls and Google Hangouts our application was picked apart. In the most helpful way, alumni had specific insights and, of course, the single most important piece of YC advice: be concise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single most important piece of YC advice: be concise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With each major rewrite I managed to cut text by another 25-40%. By our final rewrite, we were down to counting syllables instead of words. On October 10th we opened our Webplio signup list and got 56 signups from different subReddits. In true Teknically style, we submitted the application with under an hour left before it was due on October 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everybody talks about the value of being concise. Applying to YC forces that realization. The experience has shaped how I write and evaluate the clarity of a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ritz On the Rocks, Hold the Crackers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Kairos Global Summit was an annual invite only gathering of 300 of the brightest student entrepreneurs in the world. From over 50 countries and 100 top universities, Kairos entrepreneurs were tackling tough problems in health care, clean energy, education, and other fields. Two weeks before the summit, my friend and President of Kairos Canada, Desmond Choi messaged me asking if I wanted to attend the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was very surprised and honoured to be invited to the summit. Not only was this a very cool personal opportunity but with such a broad representation of entrepreneurs, VCs, and mentors, it was a great networking opportunity for Teknically. I quickly purchased plane tickets and 2 days after we submitted our YC application, I was on a flight to Los Angeles!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was hard to believe my eyes. Our hotel room overlooked the ocean and the conference events were held at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Beach down the road. I had never attended an event with such luxuries and sponsorship subsidized costs for all attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were very interesting panels with industry experts from around the world. There were coaching sessions for fundraising and pitches. There was even a showcase for the K50 top companies of the year with technical innovations across many industries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/110836607&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Highlight video for Kairos Global Summit, October 2014.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At dinners and social events I met fellow young entrepreneurs from around the world. These people, though they had accomplished so much more than me, were just as approachable, friendly, and genuine as anybody else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful entrepreneurs aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;gods&amp;quot;. We can all achieve greatness because even theirs is still only that which is possible for man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There wasn&amp;#39;t any inherent &amp;quot;super power&amp;quot; they possessed. They weren&amp;#39;t radically more intelligent or innovative. They had kept working hard and managed to take advantage of the opportunities that were presented to them. Successful entrepreneurs, whether the ones I met or Bill Gates, aren&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;gods&amp;quot;. We can all achieve greatness because even theirs is still only that which is possible for man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;From A to YC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned from Kairos emboldened to work harder towards our goals. Over the next two weeks we made great progress and continued to grow our waitlist as we patiently awaited the result of our YC application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;October 28th came and it was difficult not to keep constantly checking our email. We recognized intellectually that our chances were very slim. Over 5,500 startups apply each batch, less than 7% even get an interview, and under 2% are accepted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a better chance getting into Harvard University than  YC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally at 6:22pm the email arrived in my inbox. &amp;quot;Thank you for applying to Y Combinator. Your application looks promising and we&amp;#39;d like to meet you in person...&amp;quot; We got the interview! I called Brandon, my parents, and enjoyed a couple minutes of ecstatic celebration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were just over two weeks until the interview. With our new relationships, we set up mock interviews with YC alumni. The Velocity YC Interview prep session gave us broad perspective. With just days before our flight, we revamped our entire value proposition to make it easier to understand. Hours of practice, countless rewrites, plane tickets bought: we were ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Through the (Silicon) Valley of the Shadow of Death&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To San Francisco we flew and each minute got more exciting. From the airport we took the BART subway. From the BART we took the CalTrain. Classic train stations for all of the Silicon Valley towns from Redwood City to Menlo Park, Palo Alto to Mountain View. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was my childhood dreams coming true...I really like(d) trains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2014-12-24-the-dream-fades/train.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in Mountain View, we struck two vital aspects of valley life off the bucket list: we took an Uber to our Airbnb. A bit more practice and nap time and then we went exploring. We ended up at a nice local Italian restaurant right on the downtown Mountain View strip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m pretty impressed, Andrew. This is the type of restaurant I thought we&amp;#39;d go to tomorrow night to celebrate,&amp;quot; Brandon said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought by this time we already had a right to celebrate. We were in Silicon Valley interviewing at Y Combinator. Pretty awesome for a pair of 19 year olds straight outta the 905.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2014-12-24-the-dream-fades/YC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Y Combinator. 335 Pioneer Way, Mountain View, California.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our interview was at 11:45am on a Thursday. We had a very calm morning leading up to it. We stopped by a Turkish bakery in town for breakfast, Uber-ed to YC, and had an hour to just bask in the glow of the orange walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was exciting to finally be in the place we had dreamed of, the common thread between Dropbox, Airbnb, Thalmic Labs, Pebble, and most of the top startups from the past decade. This exhilaration was met with an equally powerful feeling of peace. Not from confidence in our preparation and in our abilities, but from my faith. I felt no anxiety or fear as words of scripture echoed through my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+23&amp;version=NIV&quot;&gt;Psalm 23&lt;/a&gt; (KJV)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2014-12-24-the-dream-fades/Duo-at-YC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Andrew and Brandon interview at Y Combinator, November 2014.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We interviewed with Sam Altman (YC President), Jessica Livingston (Founder of YC), Trevor Blackwell (Founder of YC), Jon Levy (YC lawyer), and Elizabeth Iorns (part time YC partner). Even when speaking with one of the toughest interviewing panels in the valley, I realized I wasn&amp;#39;t stressed. They were still just people, not &amp;quot;gods&amp;quot; of the startup world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ten minute interview flew by. I was happy, we had done our best, but now we had an afternoon to kill. Judgement would be passed down that evening in the form of an email (rejection) or a phone call (acceptance). Brandon and I both had our own coping strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2014-12-24-the-dream-fades/YC-Coping-Methods.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Different Coping Methods: Andrew finds out what&amp;#39;s at the bottom of a Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&amp;#39;s. Brandon...why so serious?&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got caught up on some Hawaii Five-0 episodes and then took the CalTrain up to San Francisco where we&amp;#39;d be spending the night at our friend Mike&amp;#39;s apartment. I got my camera out and had some fun capturing some of the cityscape and soon were eating at a California Pizza Kitchen...in California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/article_images/2014-12-24-the-dream-fades/Streetcar.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Classic streetcar on Market Street in San Francisco as we get the YC email.&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we were walking to the Canadians @ YC meetup we got the email. It felt like being hit by a truck but with less blood. I was intellectually prepared for the email but not emotionally. I took a few minutes to pray and collect my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept reading the email over again. They liked us as founders but didn&amp;#39;t like Webplio. They thought we&amp;#39;d make good founders of a company but that there were marketing executives who had significantly more domain expertise in analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rejection stung, but they were right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just took us another three weeks to come to this realization ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then headed to the meetup. There were free drinks to dull the emotions, a panel discussion, and I got to meet some of the YC alumi with whom I had only Skyped. All were very encouraging and supportive knowing themselves that few startups ever get the phone call for their first YC application. We headed back to Mike&amp;#39;s for the night and got a couple hours of sleep before our 4am wake up to fly home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Dream Fades&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of us took some time to try and figure out what we would do next given our limited financial runway. We could start coding ourselves and reduce outsourcing costs. We could start working on another idea. We could shut Teknically down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We settled on cutting costs and each coding, but with a new idea that we could get to market in three weeks and hopefully revenue by Christmas. In meer days I had picked up Angular.js and Brandon Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Two weeks in we had made remarkable progress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, both of us were starting to realize that the dream was fading. Over a hearty Mel&amp;#39;s Diner lunch on December 2nd, we came to the conclusion that it was the beginning of the end. After 13 months of running on fumes, we needed time to breath. It was too late for another Hail Mary pivot. We would close up shop and go back to university. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Next Chapter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our dreams for Teknically may not have been realized in the fullest, but the legacy will live on in memories, refined skills, and lessons learned. We may have fallen behind in our degrees, but we got a massive head start on life experience. That is priceless. And that is why I have &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtu.be/_DnKNClu2XM?t=1m45s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;no ragrets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thankful to many. Family and friends for your support. Dad for your guidance and steady perspective. Laurier Launchpad, Steve Farlow, Sandeep De, Dave Inglis, Anne Forler for taking a chance on a pair of first years who thought they could make Google Analytics better. Communitech. Google for Entrepreneurs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YC Alumni: Patrick Hannigan (Ticket Labs), Gareth MacLeod (Tinker),  Aditya Bali (BufferBox), Devon Galloway (Vidyard), Jim Robeson (PiinPoint), Euwyn Poon (Opzi), Trevor Creech (Tinker), Ross Robinson (Tinker), Ian Roberts (Ticket Labs) for your patience, kindness, and time whether reviewing our application, conducting mock interviews, or talking shop over burgers and Stellas. Desmond Choi and Mike Reid, fellow entrepreneurs but most importantly, friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m excited to start math classes at University of Waterloo in January and hopefully continue there in Computing and Financial Management (CFM) or Computer Science (CS) starting in Fall 2015. Brandon will be continuing in the BBA/Computer Science double degree program at Wilfrid Laurier University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is a wild journey. I&amp;#39;ve felt like I was on top of the world or other times like it&amp;#39;s caving in. Through it all, my faith has been the foundation that lets me confidently move forward to meet whatever life throws at me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the old dream fades, a new one comes into focus. Keep dreaming new dreams, eventually one will come true.&lt;/p&gt;
