Looking for a fullstack dev for your team?
---
I'm graduating from Computer Science at University of Waterloo in April 2018. I can't wait to get back to building great software with an ambitious team.

I have 4 years of experience solving problems with great code at [Atomic.vc](http://atomic.vc), startups [[1](/project/blitzen)][[2](/project/videostream)][[3](/project/teknically-webplio)], for [clients](#Freelance), [side projects](/projects), & hackathons [[4](/project/resume-scoreboard)][[5](/project/losocco)][[6](/project/stockslate)].

If you're looking for a {{ site.work_title }} to start {{ site.work_term }}, please [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Job%20Opportunity)!

P.S. Here are three recent projects below & my [GitHub](https://github.com/adrw) + [Devpost](https://devpost.com/andrewparadi)
{% for post in site.posts %}
{% if post.categories contains "Headline" %}

Need a new website?

Need a better website or custom dev work? [Email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=I%20need%20a%20new%20website)!

I’ll work to understand your current frustrations, & goals for your website.<br/>My priorities for a client website are:
1. **Easy to edit** even if you don’t know HTML
1. **Mobile first design** especially important for local businesses
1. **Low cost monthly hosting** don’t spend more than you have to
1. **Search engine optimized** stay on Google's good side

If you'd like to see some case studies of past clients, I've included some below. When you're ready, [email me](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=I%20need%20a%20new%20website) &amp; we can start discussing the best approach for you.

{% for post in site.posts %}
{% if post.categories contains "Featured" and post.categories contains "Freelance" %}
  - [**{{ post.title }}**]({{ post.permalink }}) {{ post.excerpt }}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

<div class="cards-wrapper btn-read-more">

Are you a startup founder?

I have experience developing successful competition & customer pitches, and in writing applications for government grants such as OCE SmartStart and SR&ED Credits. If you've got any questions or would like some coaching on an upcoming pitch, [send me an email](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Pitch%20Coaching)!

If you're considering a Business Model Canvas Competition or applying to Y Combinator, my past [Teknically pitches](/project/teknically-webplio#canada-business-model-25000-winning-pitch) or other startup experience may be helpful.
