Hi, I'm Andrew! Hire me!
-----

![](/assets/images/about-header.jpg)

I'm graduating from **computer science at University of Waterloo** in 2018.

I have 3+ years of experience solving problems with great code at [Atomic.vc](http://atomic.vc), startups [[1](/project/blitzen)][[2](/project/videostream)][[3](/project/teknically-webplio/)], for [clients](/project/franks-jewellers/), [side projects](/projects), & Hack the North [[4](/project/resume-scoreboard/)][[5](/project/losocco/)][[6](/project/stockslate/)].

**I want to work on tough problems with other user-focused devs.**

If you want to chat about how I could bring value to your dev team...<br/>
**Please email [*me at andrewparadi.com*](mailto:me@andrewparadi.com)**.

P.S. If you [need a new website](#freelance-website--software-development) or some [help with your startup pitch](#copywriting--pitch-coaching)...

...hmmm, maybe that's a bit too forward
-----

Let's try this again!

I'm Andrew Paradi, straight from the `905` ...aka Mississauga.

I love reading, playing trumpet in the UW Jazz Band, starting businesses, and working on side projects (like [DuckDuckGo search for the Tor browser](http://www.andrewparadi.com/torduckgo/)).

I thrive working on user-focused teams. MVP & user experience >`l33t code`. User A/B split test data > personal design preferences & startup lingo.

I work as a software dev intern at [Atomic.vc](http://atomic.vc) in Kitchener.

So why should you hire me?
-----
**I learn quickly**. Whether at Hack the North ([2016](/project/resume-scoreboard/), [2015](/project/losocco/), [2014](/project/stockslate/)), or [Atomic.vc](http://atomic.vc), I pick up new tools quickly to solve problems with code.

I have a **strong attention to detail**. With user experiences, interfaces, sales copy, and writing code, I spot issues and fix them before code review.

I'm **focused on solving problems**. Unnecessary dev work misses deadlines. I write what is minimally necessary to solve the problem at hand.

**I have strong experience building with:**
- ReactJS with Redux, NodeJS, Git, Docker, Docker Compose
- Javascript ES5 & ES6 & ES7, HTML5, CSS3, SASS
- C, C++, Bash
- Wordpress, Squarespace, Jekyll

**I am familiar with:**
- EmberJS, AngularJS 1.4 & 2
- Ruby on Rails, Django, Python3
- PostgreSQL, Neo4j

**My code, pitches, and sales copy have successfully:**

- Boosted **inbound signups by 74%** with new site design & copy [[7](/project/blitzen)]
- Increased **active users by 12%** for a 1.2 million user app [[8](/blog/videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/)]
- Won over **$65,000** in competition prizes &amp; grants [[9](/project/teknically-webplio/)][[10](/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/)][[11](/blog/the-dream-fades/)]
- Been part of **Google for Entrepreneurs** Cohort 2 [[12](/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/)]
- Wrote application and interviewed at **Y Combinator** [[13](/blog/the-dream-fades/)]
- ...& even **elected a President** [[14](/project/sam-campaign)]

Freelance Website & Software Development
-----

***Are you a startup founder?***

If you need an MVP or new feature built, [let's talk](mailto:me@andrewparadi.com?subject=Software%20consulting%3F). I can help get it done.

***Do you need a new website?***

![](/assets/article_images/2015-08-09-franks-jewellers/comparison.png)

If your website needs work but you don't know where to start, [let's talk](mailto:me@andrewparadi.com?subject=I%20need%20a%20new%20website).

I'll work to understand your current frustrations, & goals for your website.

We then can work on a plan forward usually including these priorities:
- **Easy to edit** (even if you don't know HTML!)
- **Mobile first design** (especially important depending on your business)
- **Search engine optimized** (becoming less important but still vital)
- **Low cost monthly hosting** (don't spend more than you have to)

> "The new website just looks fantastic and it even kept with our look and feel that we use in other marketing. After the training from Andrew, we’ve been uploading new diamonds when they come in and even been getting some new customers as a result. Couldn’t recommend him enough!”
- Bob Frank, owner of [Frank's Jewellers](/project/franks-jewellers), client in 2015

You can read more about Bob's experience with his new website [here](/project/franks-jewellers).

If this sounds like a better approach to improving your website, [email me](mailto:me@andrewparadi.com?subject=I%20need%20a%20new%20website)!

Copywriting & Pitch Coaching
-----

Discovering how to communicate the unique value proposition for your startup can be tough.

***When you tell people about your startup, do they seem to have the same basic questions that you can't seem to answer in an initial pitch?***

***Do you feel your pitch is always a bit short of impressing the judges?***

With four years of experience writing A/B test beating sales copy [[15](/project/blitzen)][[16](/project/videostream)] and designing pitches that win competitions [[17](/project/teknically-webplio)], I might be able to help.

If you'd like a fresh perspective on your messaging, [send me an email](mailto:me@andrewparadi.com).
