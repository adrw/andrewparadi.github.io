<h1>About</h1>
I love working on teams that are focused on the end user. Whether that's building software or writing sales copy, I'm driven to find what matters most to customers and have a bias for features and marketing strategies that deliver results. 

I learn quickly. I've picked up effective online marketing techniques from <a href="https://copyhackers.com/" target="_blank">Copyhackers</a>, <a href="https://moz.com/blog" target="_blank">Moz</a>, &amp; <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/" target="_blank">Kissmetrics</a>. I've had practical coding experience on websites and applications used by millions of people. 

My online marketing and code has successfully <a href="http://andrewparadi.com/projects/videostream">grown user bases</a>, <a href="http://andrewparadi.com/projects/teknically-webplio/">won thousands</a> in competition prize and grant money (<a href="http://andrewparadi.com/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/">1</a>, <a href="http://andrewparadi.com/blog/the-dream-fades/">2</a>), and even <a href="http://andrewparadi.com/projects/sam-campaign">elected a President</a>.


<h2>Why email Andrew?</h2>
I'm looking for a <strong>summer 2016 internship</strong> at an organization where I can tackle some ambitious projects. [Email me](mailto:me@andrewparadi.com) if you want an intern on your team that will deliver.

Reach out if you're a <strong>local startup founder</strong> looking for a fresh perspective on why your landing page isn't bringing you customers that stick. I do consulting for writing effective sales copy, building landing pages that convert, and improving software user retention. I enjoy mentoring early stage startup founders how to find their first customers, scope out the easiest software MVP that can test your assumptions, and navigate the opportunities of the Kitchener-Waterloo tech community.
