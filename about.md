Work Experience
-----

I love working on teams that are focused on the end user. Whether that's building software or writing sales copy, I'm driven to find out what matters most to customers. 

I have an unwavering bias for features and marketing strategies that deliver results. 

I learn quickly. Whether at **Hack the North** ([2014](/project/stockslate/), [2015](/project/losocco/)) or at **[Videostream](/project/videostream/)**, I pick up frameworks quickly to write code that performs under the scrutiny of code reviews and win competitions.

My pitches, online marketing, and code have successfully:

- Increased active users by 12% in one week for an app that already had over 1.2 million users ([1](blog/videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/))
- Won over **$65,000** in commpetition prizes &amp; grants ([2](/project/teknically-webplio/), [3](/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/), [4](/blog/the-dream-fades/))
- Been part of **Google for Entrepreneurs** Cohort 2 ([5](/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/))
- Led to an interview at **Y Combinator** ([6](/blog/the-dream-fades/))
- &amp; even **elected a President** ([7](/project/sam-campaign))...


New KW Startup Founders
-----

I've had my fair share of experiences as an early stage tech startup founder in Kitchener Waterloo. If you're a local founder, I'm always down to grab a coffee at [DVLB](http://dvlb.ca/) and chat. I have strong experience in how to write successful government grant applications (OCE SmartStart), pitches that win competitions, &amp; sales copy that gets your first MVP alpha customers. Email me at andrewparadi.com and we'll find a time to meet up.
