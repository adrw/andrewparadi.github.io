Hi, I'm Andrew!
-----

![](/assets/images/about-header.jpg)

Welcome! Explore my side [projects](/projects/), [andrewnotes](/blog/) blog, [work](/work/) experience, [resume](/assets/files/AndrewParadiResume.pdf), &amp; [github](https://github.com/andrewparadi). 

I currently work at [Blitzen](https://blitzen.com) as a developer & copywriting intern. In the fall, I'll be back at University of Waterloo studying computer science and be searching for a **Winter 2017 internship**.

I actively write on my [andrewnotes](/blog/) blog, build a [Pebble app](http://andrewparadi.com/progress-pebble/), and post scripture & scenery photographs on [@andrewnotes Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/andrewnotes/).

Work Experience
-----

I thrive working on user-focused teams. Whether building software or writing copy that converts, I'm driven to discover what matters most to customers.

I have an unwavering bias for features and growth strategies that deliver results. Data wins over personal preference, 8 days a week. 

I learn quickly. Whether at **Hack the North** ([2014](/project/stockslate/), [2015](/project/losocco/)), **[Videostream](/project/videostream/)** or now at [Blitzen](https://blitzen.com), I pick up frameworks quickly to write code that performs under the scrutiny of code reviews and pressure of competition.

**This summer I've expanded my stack to include:**

- AngularJS 2
- Firebase
- Django (Python 3)
- PostgreSQL
- HTML5, CSS3/SASS, Javascript ES6
- C, C++, Bash

**My pitches, conversion sales copy, and code have successfully:**

- Boosted inbound signups by 81% with new site design & copy [[1](https://blitzen.com)] 
- Increased **active users by 12%** for a 1.2 million user app [[2](blog/videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/)]
- Won over **$65,000** in competition prizes &amp; grants [[3](/project/teknically-webplio/)], [[4](/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/)], [[5](/blog/the-dream-fades/)]
- Been part of **Google for Entrepreneurs** Cohort 2 [[6](/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/)]
- Wrote application and interviewed at **Y Combinator** [[7](/blog/the-dream-fades/)]
- &amp; even **elected a President** [[8](/project/sam-campaign)]...


New KW Startup Founders
-----

I've had my fair share of experiences as an early stage tech startup founder in Kitchener Waterloo. If you're a local founder, I'm always down to grab a coffee at  [DVLB](http://dvlb.ca/) and chat. I have strong experience in how to write successful government grant applications (OCE SmartStart), pitches that win competitions, &amp; sales copy that gets your first MVP alpha customers. Email *me at andrewparadi.com* and we'll find a time to meet up.


Internship Opportunities
-----

I have strong coding &amp; communication skills recognized in competition and I'm looking for a **Winter 2017 technical internship**. 

Email [*me at andrewparadi.com*](mailto:me@andrewparadi.com) if your team wants to work with a **go-getter** who **learns quickly and thrives under pressure**.
