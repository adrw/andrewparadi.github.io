##Hi, I'm Andrew!
Welcome to the site! My past [projects](/) and [blog](/blog/) posts are the best way to understand who I am, what I've worked on, and how I approach a problem. For a more summarized look at my work experience, please check out my [resume](/assets/files/AndrewParadiResume.pdf), which includes a reference letter from my most recent position as a [Growth Intern at Videostream](/project/videostream/). 

I'm looking for an internship for Summer 2016 so if you think I'd be a good fit for your team, please email me at [me@andrewparadi.com](mailto:me@andrewparadi.com)!

##Work Experience
I love working on teams that are focused on the end user. Whether that's building software or writing sales copy, I'm driven to find what matters most to customers and have a bias for features and marketing strategies that deliver results. 

I learn quickly. I've written production code for websites and applications used by [millions of people](/project/videostream/). I've picked up effective online marketing techniques from [Copyhackers](https://copyhackers.com/), [Moz](https://moz.com/blog), &amp; [Kissmetrics](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/) that have [grown user bases and revenue](/project/videostream/).

My online marketing and code has successfully [won thousands](/project/teknically-webplio/) in competition prize and grant money ([1](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/), [2](http://andrewparadi.com/blog/the-dream-fades/), and even [elected a President](project/sam-campaign).


##Why email Andrew?
I'm looking for a **summer 2016 technical internship** at an organization where I can tackle some ambitious projects. [Email me](mailto:me@andrewparadi.com) if you want an intern on your team that will deliver.

###Other KW Founders
Reach out if you're a <strong>local startup founder</strong> looking for a fresh perspective on why your landing page isn't bringing you customers that stick. I do consulting for writing effective sales copy, building landing pages that convert, and improving software user retention. I enjoy mentoring early stage startup founders how to find their first customers, scope out the easiest software MVP that can test your assumptions, and navigate the opportunities of the Kitchener-Waterloo tech community.
