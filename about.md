Work Experience
-----

I love working on teams that are focused on the end user. Whether that's building software or writing sales copy, I'm driven to find what matters most to customers. 

I have an unwavering bias for features and marketing strategies that deliver results. 

I learn quickly. Whether at **Hack the North** ([2014](/project/stockslate/), [2015](/project/losocco/)) or at [Videostream](/project/videostream/), I've picked up frameworks quickly to write code that performs under the scrutiny of code reviews and win competitions.

My pitches, online marketing, and code has successfully [won over $65,000](/project/teknically-webplio/) in competition prizes &amp; grant money ([1](/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/), [2](/blog/the-dream-fades/)), led to **[interviewing at Y Combinator](/blog/the-dream-fades/)**, and even [elected a President](project/sam-campaign).
