I'm graduating from Computer Science at University of Waterloo in April 2018.

I have 4 years of experience solving problems with great code at [Atomic.vc](http://atomic.vc), startups [[1](/project/blitzen)][[2](/project/videostream)][[3](/project/teknically-webplio)], for [clients](/contact#need-a-new-website), [side projects](/projects), & hackathons [[4](/project/resume-scoreboard)][[5](/project/losocco)][[6](/project/stockslate)].

I can't wait to get back to building great software with an ambitious team.

If you're looking for a full stack dev who learns quickly, please [email me](mailto:me@andrewparadi.com?subject=Job%20Opportunity)!
