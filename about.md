Hi, I'm Andrew!
-----

![](/assets/images/about-header.jpg)

Welcome to the site! Check out my [projects](/projects/), [andrewnotes](/blog/) blog, [work](/work/) experience, [resume](/assets/files/AndrewParadiResume.pdf), &amp; [github](https://github.com/andrewparadi). 

I currently work at [Blitzen](https://blitzen.com) as a developer & copywriting intern. In the fall, I'll be back at University of Waterloo studying computer science.

I actively write on my [andrewnotes](/blog/) blog, build a [Pebble app](http://andrewparadi.com/progress-pebble/), and post scripture & scenery photographs on [@andrewnotes Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/andrewnotes/).

Work Experience
-----

I thrive working on teams focused on the end user. Whether that's building software or writing copy that converts, I'm driven to find out what matters most to customers.

I have an unwavering bias for features and marketing strategies that deliver results. 

I learn quickly. Whether at **Hack the North** ([2014](/project/stockslate/), [2015](/project/losocco/)), **[Videostream](/project/videostream/)** or now at [Blitzen](https://blitzen.com), I pick up frameworks quickly to write code that performs under the scrutiny of code reviews and pressure of competition.

My pitches, online marketing, and code have successfully:

- Increased active users by 12% in one week for an app that already had over 1.2 million users ([1](blog/videostream-how-growth-starts-with-great-customer-support/))
- Won over **$65,000** in competition prizes &amp; grants ([2](/project/teknically-webplio/), [3](/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/), [4](/blog/the-dream-fades/))
- Been part of **Google for Entrepreneurs** Cohort 2 ([5](/blog/the-389-day-laurier-bba/))
- Led to an interview at **Y Combinator** ([6](/blog/the-dream-fades/))
- &amp; even **elected a President** ([7](/project/sam-campaign))...


New KW Startup Founders
-----

I've had my fair share of experiences as an early stage tech startup founder in Kitchener Waterloo. If you're a local founder, I'm always down to grab a coffee at [DVLB](http://dvlb.ca/) and chat. I have strong experience in how to write successful government grant applications (OCE SmartStart), pitches that win competitions, &amp; sales copy that gets your first MVP alpha customers. Email me at andrewparadi.com and we'll find a time to meet up.
