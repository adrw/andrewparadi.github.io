lyrics: |
  [Verse 1]
  When I was six years old I broke my leg
  And I was running  from my brother and his friends
  And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass as I rolled down
  I was younger  then,  take me back to when I

  [Pre-Chorus 1]
  Found my heart and broke it here
  Made friends and lost them through the years
  And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
  But I can't wait to go home

  [Chorus 1]
  I'm on my   way, driving at ninety
  Down those country  lanes singing to Tiny Dancer
  And I miss the  way you make  me feel      and it's real
  When we watched the  sunset over the castle on the hill

  [Verse 2]
  Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
  Running from the law through the backfields and  getting drunk with my friends
  Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon I did it
  Right, I was younger  then,  take me back to when we found

  [Pre-Chorus 2]
  Weekend jobs and when we got paid
  We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
  Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
  But I can't wait to go home

  [Chorus 2]
  I'm on my   way, driving at ninety
  Down those country  lanes singing to Tiny Dancer
  And I miss the  way you make  me feel      and it's real
  We watched the  sunset over the castle on the hill

                        Over the castle on the hill
                        Over the castle on the hill

  [Bridge]

  One friend left to sell clothes and, one works down by the coast
  One had two kids but lives alone, one's brother overdosed
  One's already on his second wife, one's just barely getting by but
  These people raised me and I-I-I, can't wait to go home

  [Chorus 3]
  And I'm on my   way, I still remember
  These old country  lanes when we did not know the answers
  And I miss the  way you make  me feel      and it's real
  We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill

                        Over the castle on the hill
                        Over the castle on the hill
