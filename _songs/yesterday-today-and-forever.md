lyrics: |
  Verse 1:
  Everlasting God
  The years go by but you’re unchanging
  In this fragile world
  You are the only firm foundation

  Pre-Chorus:
  Always loving, always true
  Always merciful and good, so good

  Chorus:
  Yesterday today and forever
  You are the same, you never change
  Yesterday today and forever
  You are faithful and we will trust in You

  Intro 2x

  Verse 2:
  Uncreated One
  You have no end and no beginning
  Earthly power fades
  But there is no end to Your kingdom

  Pre-Chorus

  Chorus 2x

  Interlude: (D/G, D/F)2x

  Bridge:
  Yahweh, God unchanging
  Yahweh, firm foundation
  You are Yahweh, God unchanging
  You are Yahweh, firm foundation
