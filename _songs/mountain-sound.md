lyrics: |
  [Verse]
  I heard them calling in the distance
  So I packed my things and ran
  Far away from all the trouble
  I had caused with my two hands
  Alone we traveled on with nothing but a shadow
  We fled far away

  [Chorus]
  Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
  Through the woods we ran (Deep in to the Mountain Sound)
  Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
  Through the woods we ran

  [Verse]
  Some hid scars and some hid scratches
  It made me wonder about their past
  And as I looked around I began to notice
  That we were nothing like the rest


  [Chorus]
  Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
  Through the woods we ran (Deep in to the Mountain Sound)
  Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
  Through the woods we ran

  [Bridge]
        Wooooah      (We sleep until the sun goes down)
        Wooooah      (We sleep until the sun goes down)
        Wooooah      (We sleep until the sun goes down)

  [Chorus]
  Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
  Through the woods we ran (Deep in to the Mountain Sound)
  Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
  Through the woods we ran

  Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
  Through the woods we ran (Deep in to the Mountain Sound)
  Hold your horses now (We sleep until the sun goes down)
  Through the woods we ran

  [Outro]
  La la la Wooooah La la la (We sleep until the sun goes down)
  La la la Wooooah La la la (We sleep until the sun goes...)
