  [Intro]

  [Verse 1]
  Let the King of my heart  Be the mountain where I run
  The fountain I drink from  Oh, He is my song.
  Let the King of my heart  Be the shadow where I hide
  The ransom for my life   Oh, He is my song.


  [Chorus]
  You are good, good, oh
  You are good, good, oh
  You are good, good, oh
  You are good, good, oh


  [Verse 2]
  Let the King of my heart  Be the wind inside my sails
  The anchor in the waves  Oh, He is my song.
  Let the King of my heart  Be the fire inside my veins
  The echo of my days  Oh, He is my song.


  [Chorus]
  You are good, good, oh
  You are good, good, oh
  You are good, good, oh
  You are good, good, oh


  [Bridge 1]
    You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down
    You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down
    You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down
    You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down
    You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down
    You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down
    You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down
    You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down


  [Chorus]
  You are good, good, oh
  You are good, good, oh
  You are good, good, oh
  You are good, good, oh


  [Bridge 2]
  ... You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down
  ... You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down
  ... You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down
  ... You’re never gonna let, never gonna let me down


  [Instrumental]

  [Outro]
  When the night is holding on to me   God is holding on
  When the night is holding on to me   God is holding on
