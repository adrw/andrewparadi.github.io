lyrics: |
  [Chorus]
  We're jamming
  I wanna jam it with you,
  We're jamming jamming
  and I hope you like jamming too.
  Ain't no rules ain't no vow we can do it anyhow
  and I Jah know will see you through,
  'Cos every day we pay the price with a loving sacrifice
  jamming till the jam is through.

  [Verse]
  We're jamming
  to think that jamming was a thing of the past,
  We're jamming
  and I hope this jam is gonna last.
  No bullet can stop us now we neither beg nor will we bow
  neither can be bought nor sold.
  We all defend the right that the children us unite,
  your life is worth much more than gold.

  [Bridge]
  We're jamming jamming jamming jamming
  We're jamming in the name of the Lord.
  We're jamming jamming jamming jamming
  We're jamming right straight from Jah.
  Holy mount Zion
  Holy mount Zion
  Jah sitteth in mount Zion
  And rules all Creation, yeah we're,
  we're jamming.

  [Chorus]
  We're jamming
  I wanna jam it with you.
  We're jamming jamming
  I'm jammed I hope you're jamming too.
  Jam's about my pride and tryth I cannot hide
  to keep you satisfied.
  True love that now exist is the love I can't resist
  so jam by my side.
