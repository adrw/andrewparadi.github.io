excerpt: "The Rocky Road to Dublin | Songs | Andrew Paradi"
lyrics: |
  In the merry month of June,  When first from home I started
  Left the girls of Tuam,  So sad and broken hearted
  Saluted Father dear,  Kissed me darlin' Mother
  And drank a pint of beer,  Me grief and tears to smother
  Then off to reap the corn,  Leave where I was born
  Cut a stout blackthorn,  To banish ghosts and goblin
  Bought a pair of brogues,  Rattle over the bogs
  Frightened all the dogs,  On the rocky road to Dublin

  One, Two, Three, Four, Five
  Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
  And all the ways to Dublin, Whack fol la de da

  When in Mullingar that night,  I rested limbs so weary
  Started by daylight, Me spirits bright and early
  Took a drop o' pure, Keep me heart from sinking
  That's a paddy's cure,  Whenever he's on drinking
  To see the lassie's smile,  Laughing all the while
  At me curious style,   Would set your heart to bubbling
  Asked me I was hired, Wages I required
  I was almost tired, On the rocky road to Dublin

  One, Two, Three, Four, Five
  Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
  And all the ways to Dublin, Whack fol la de da

  Well in Dublin next arrived,  I thought it be a pity
  To be so soon deprived, A view of that fine city
  Then I took a stroll,  All among the quality
  Me bundle it was stole,  In a neat locality
  Something crossed me mind,  When I looked behind
  No bundle could I find,  Upon me stick a wobbling
  Enquiring after the rogue, They said me Connacht brouge
  Wasn't much in vogue, On the rocky road to Dublin

  One, Two, Three, Four, Five
  Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
  And all the ways to Dublin, Whack fol la de da

  Well, From  there I got away,  Me spirits never failing
  Landed on the quay,  Just as the ship was sailing
  Captain at me roared,  Said that no room had he
  When I jumped aboard,  A cabin found for Paddy
  Down among the pigs,  Played some hearty rigs
  Danced some hearty jigs,  The water round me bubblin'
  When off Holyhead,  I wished meself was dead
  Or, Better far instead,  On the rocky road to Dublin

  One, Two, Three, Four, Five
  Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
  And all the ways to Dublin, Whack fol la de da

  Well, The boys of Liverpool,  When we safely landed
  Called meself a fool,  I could no longer stand it
  Blood began to boil,  Temper I was losing
  Poor ould Erins Isle,  They began abusing
  Hurrah me soul says I,    Shillelagh I let fly
  Some Galway boys were by,  Saw I was a-hollerin'
  Then with a loud horray,  They joined in the affray
  We quickly cleared the way,  For the rocky road to Dublin

  One, Two, Three, Four, Five
  Hunt the hare and turn her down the rocky road
  And all the ways to Dublin, Whack   fol   la      de daaaa
