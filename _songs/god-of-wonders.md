lyrics: |
  [Intro]

  [Verse 1]
      Lord of all creation
  Of water, earth, and sky
  The heavens are You tabernacle
  Glory to the Lord on high

  [Chorus]
  God of wonders beyond our galaxy
  You are holy, holy
  The universe declares Your majesty
  You are holy, holy

  [Bridge]
  Lord of heaven and earth
  Lord of heaven and earth

  [Verse 2]
      Early in the morning,
  I will celebrate the light.
  When I stumble in the darkness,
  I will call Your Name by night.

  [Chorus]
  God of wonders beyond our galaxy
  You are holy, holy
  The universe declares Your majesty
  You are holy, holy

  [Bridge 1]
  Lord of heaven and earth
  Lord of heaven and earth

  [Bridge 2]
  Hallelujah
  To the Lord of heaven and earth... (3x)

  [Chorus]
  God of wonders beyond our galaxy
  You are holy, holy
  Precious Lord, reveal your heart to me
  Father hold me, hold me
  The universe declares Your majesty
  You are holy, holy, holy, holy

  [Bridge 2]
  Hallelujah
  To the Lord of heaven and earth... (6x)
