excerpt: "Raised on Black & Tans | Songs | Andrew Paradi"
lyrics: |
  I was raised   on Black and Tans,
  with Ronnie Drew,   and Van the Man
  I go off to mass on Sunday
  and then it's back to the pub on Monday
  I've got a sister Meghan
  with a Celtic cross tattoo
  I'll tell you a few stories
  and every one of them is true

  [[CHORUS]]
  My mother's, brother's, sister's, cousin's, auntie's
  Uncle Barney's, father's, brother had a counsin from Killarney

  Well my great-grandda, and his mates
  they tried to make it to the States
  his great uncle, he was a failure
  he got deported off to Australia
  so they stowed upon a steamer
  on the famous White Star Line
  I was raised upon these stories
  since i was the age of nine

  [[CHORUS]]
  Well my great uncle, he liked the races
  he liked the dogs and steeplechases
  his wife, my dear old auntie
  she kept a teashop way, way down in Bantry
  but he fixed a race in Donegal
  and now he's got to hide
  with the sticky buns and cakes and guns
  and whiskey on the side

  [[CHORUS]]
  I was raised on Black and Tans
  with Ronnie Drew and Van the Man
  I go to mass on Sunday
  and the it's back to the pub on Monday
  I'm from the wrong side of the south side
  of an Irish neighborhood
  I've never been to Ireland
  but I know it's in my blood

  [[CHORUS]]
