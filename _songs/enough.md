  [Verse]
  you are my supply
  My breath of life
  Still more awesome then I know
  you are my reward
  Worth living for
  Still more awesome then I know

  [CHORUS:]
  All of you is more then enough for
  All of me for every thirst and every need
  you satisfy me with your love
  and All I have in you is more then enough

  [VERSE 2:]
  You're my sacrifice
  of greatest price
  still more awesome then I know
  your my coming king
  you are everything
  still more awesome then I know

  [REPEAT CHORUS]

  [BRIDGE:]
  More then all I want
  more then all I need
  you are more then enough for me
  More then all I know
  more then all I can see
  You are more then enough
