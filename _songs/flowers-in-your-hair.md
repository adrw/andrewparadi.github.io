excerpt: "Flowers In Your Hair | Songs | Andrew Paradi Alexander"
lyrics: |
  [Verse]
  When we were younger
  We thought everyone was on our side
  Then we grew a little
  And romanticized the time I saw
  Flowers in your hair
  Takes a boy to live
  Takes a man to pretend he was there

  So then we grew a little
  Knew a lot
  And now we demonstrated it to the cops
  And all the things we said
  We were self assured
  It's a long road to wisdom
  It's a short one to being ignored

  [Chorus]
  Be in my eye
  Be in my heart
  Be in my eye, eyeyeye
  Be in my heart

  [Verse]
  So now I think that I could love you back
  And I hope its not too late
  'Cause youre so attractive
  And the way you move
  I won't close my eyes
  Takes a man to live
  Takes a woman to make him compromise

  [Chorus]
  Be in my eye
  Be in my heart
  Be in my eye, eyeyeye
  Be in my heart

G
When we were younger
G
We thought everyone was on our side
G
Then we grew a little
                    Cadd9
And romanticized the time I saw
                     G
Flowers in your hair
        D
Takes a boy to live
      Cadd9                            G
Takes a man to pretend he was there

G
So then we grew a little
G
Knew a lot
G
And now we demonstrated it to the cops
             Cadd9
And all the things we said
                         G
We were self assured
        D
It's a long road to wisdom
       Cadd9                         G
It's a short one to being ignored

[Chorus]
         Em     D
Be in my eye
             G
Be in my heart
         Em           D
Be in my eye, eyeyeye
             G
Be in my heart

[Verse]
G
So now I think that I could love you back
G
And I hope its not too late
G
'Cause youre so attractive
       Cadd9
And the way you move
                     G
I won't close my eyes
         D
Takes a man to live
        Cadd9                             G
Takes a woman to make him compromise

[Chorus]
         Em     D
Be in my eye
             G
Be in my heart
         Em           D
Be in my eye, eyeyeye
             G
Be in my heart
