  [Intro]

  [Verse]
  She sits him down in a stiff chair
  Rubs his back and strokes his hair
  Telling him it's okay to cry
  But he just sits and stares


  The merciless moon outside
  Has nothing now he's come to realise
  Only the desolation he feels
  The cold distance inside

  [Chorus]

  But you and I now
  We can be alright
  Just hold on to what we know is true
  You and I now
  Though it's cold inside
  Feel the tide turning

  [Verse]
  While the priest just sits and weeps
  Lamenting the fact that he can see
  Darkness and light in so much detail
  He has given himself over


  Refusing what he knows to be real
  He turns away from every meal
  Starving himself of goodness
  He doesn't think he can heal

  [Chorus]

  But you and I now
  We can be alright
  Just hold on to what we know is true
  You and I now
  Though it's cold inside
  Feel the tide turning

  [Verse]
  "What if I lost all I had?"
  Said the stranger to his dad
  And the witness was confused
  He can't tell what is bad


  Instead he runs up to the nearest girl
  And he comments on her glorious curls
  Says, "Darling come with me
  I'll show you a whole new world"

  [Chorus]

  But you and I now
  We can be alright
  Just hold on to what we know is true
  You and I now
  Though it's cold inside
  Feel the tide turning
