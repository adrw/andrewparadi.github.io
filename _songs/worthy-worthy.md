lyrics: |
  [Intro]

  [Verse]
  No pen or quill, no scribe in perfect skill
  With flawless words could capture all You are
  No lofty thought, no scholar of this world
  Could grasp an inch of such infinity

  Though we cannot comprehend such a mystery
  Just a glimpse of You revealed is compelling us to sing

  [Chorus]
  Holy, holy is the Lord God almighty
  Worthy, worthy is Your Name
  All of Heaven joins the universe ever crying
  Worthy, worthy is Your name

  [Verse]
  With hearts amazed and songs that never frame
  The fullness of your worth and majesty
  We come again and fall on bended knee
  And here adore the God that we don't see

  Though we cannot comprehend such a mystery
  Just a glimpse of You revealed is compelling us to sing

  [Chorus]
  Holy, holy is the Lord God almighty
  Worthy, worthy is Your Name
  All of Heaven joins the universe ever crying
  Worthy, worthy is Your name

  Holy, holy is the Lord God almighty
  Worthy, worthy is Your Name
  All of Heaven joins the universe ever crying
  Worthy, worthy is Your name

  [Post-Chorus]
  Yeah,              Worthy is Your name Jesus

  [Verse]
  When You return, we'll hear the trumpet sound
  You'll lead us home riding on the clouds
  Where we will stand and sing forevermore
  The honor and the praise, the glory is the Lord's

  [Chorus]
  Holy, holy is the Lord God almighty
  Worthy, worthy is Your Name
  All of Heaven joins the universe ever crying
  Worthy, worthy is Your name

  Holy, holy is the Lord God almighty
  Worthy, worthy is Your Name
  All of Heaven joins the universe ever crying
  Worthy, worthy is Your name
  Worthy, worthy is Your name, Jesus
  Worthy, worthy is Your name
